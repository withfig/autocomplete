## üëã What are "completion specs"?

A completion spec is a _declarative_ schema that specifies the `subcommands`,
`options` and `args` for a CLI tool. Amazon Q uses these schemas to generate
suggestions.

<br/>

## üòé Contribute your first spec in < 3 minutes

Use the steps below or follow our getting started guide:
[fig.io/docs](https://fig.io/docs)

**Prerequisites:**

- Download Amazon Q for command line
- Node and Pnpm

<br/>

**Steps**

1. Make sure you have `pnpm` [installed](https://pnpm.io/installation), as
   that's the package manager used in this repo.

2. Click [here](https://GitHub.com/withfig/autocomplete/fork/) to fork this
   repo.

3. Clone your forked repo and create an example spec

   ```bash
   # Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your own GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/autocomplete.git autocomplete
   cd autocomplete

   # Add withfig/autocomplete as a remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete.git

   # Install packages
   pnpm install

   # Create an example spec (call it "abc")
   pnpm create-spec abc

   # Turn on "dev mode"
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Now go to your terminal and type `abc[space]`. Your example spec will appear.
   üòä

#### Other things to know

- Edit your spec in TypeScript in the `src/` folder
- On save, specs are compiled to the `build/` folder
- In **dev mode**, specs are read from the `build` folder, and generators run
  every keystroke.

<br>

## üì¶ Other available package.json commands

```bash
# Typecheck all specs in the src/ folder
pnpm test

# Compile typescripts specs from src/ folder to build/ folder
pnpm build

# Lint and fix issues
pnpm lint:fix
```
