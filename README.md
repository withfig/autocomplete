## üëã What are "completion specs"?

A completion spec is a _declarative_ schema that specifies the `subcommands`, `options` and `args` for a CLI tool. Fig uses these schemas to generate suggestions.

<br/>

## üòé Contribute your first spec in < 3 minutes

Use the steps below or follow our getting started guide: [fig.io/docs](https://fig.io/docs)

**Prerequisites:**

- Download Fig for macOS
- Node and NPM (or Yarn)

<br/>

**Steps**

1. Click [here](https://GitHub.com/withfig/autocomplete/fork/) to fork this repo.

2. Clone your forked repo and create an example spec

   ```bash
   # Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your own github username
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/autocomplete.git fig-autocomplete
   cd fig-autocomplete

   # Add withfig/autocomplete as a remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete.git

   # Install packages
   npm install

   # Create an example spec (call it "abc")
   npm run create-spec abc

   # Turn on "dev mode"
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Now go to your terminal and type `abc[space]`. Your example spec will appear. üòä

#### Other things to know

- Edit your spec in TypeScript in the `src/` folder
- On save, specs are compiled to the `build/` folder
- In **dev mode**, specs are read from the `build` folder, and generators run every keystroke.

<br>

## üè† Make completions for local scripts

You can use Fig's autocomplete for your own tools too. Here's how to create private completions:

```bash
# Make sure you're in your home directory
cd ~

# Create your .fig/autocomplete folder
npx @withfig/autocomplete-tools init
cd ~/.fig/autocomplete

# Create your completions!
npm run create-spec xyz
npm run publish-spec -p src/xyz.ts
```

You can also create completions for project scripts, or even add custom suggestions to official specs. Read more at [fig.io/docs/guides/private-autocomplete](https://fig.io/docs/guides/private-autocomplete)

<br/>

## üì¶ Other available package.json commands

```bash
# Typecheck all specs in the src/ folder
npm test

# Compile typescripts specs from src/ folder to build/ folder
npm run build

# Lint and fix issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## üî• Contributions

We would love contributions for:

- new completion specs
- errors with existing completion specs (e.g. missing subcommands, options, or arguments)
