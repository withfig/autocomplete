**[Fig](https://fig.io?ref=github_autocomplete) adds autocomplete to your terminal.**

As you type, Fig pops up subcommands, options, and contextually relevant arguments in your existing terminal on macOS.

## üëã Add a completion spec for a CLI tool

Want to add autocomplete to a CLI tool (or make changes to an existing autocomplete spec)? We welcome contributions!

Completion specs are defined in a _declarative_ schema that specifies `subcommands`, `options` and `arguments`. Suggestions are generated from information in the spec or can be generated dynamically by running shell commands or reading local files.

**For documentation and tutorials**, visit [fig.io/docs](https://fig.io/docs)

**To request autocomplete for a CLI tool**, open an [issue](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete/issues/new/choose).

<br/>

## üòé Get Started

Build your first spec in 3 min or less: [fig.io/docs/getting-started](https://fig.io/docs/getting-started)

**Prerequisites:**

- Early access to the Fig macOS app.
  > If you don't have access yet, sign up for the [waitlist](https://fig.io) and say you're interested in building completions!
- Node and NPM (or Yarn).

<br/>

**Setup:**

1. Click [here](https://GitHub.com/withfig/autocomplete/fork/) to fork this repo.

2. Clone your forked repo and create an example spec

```bash
# Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your own github username
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/autocomplete.git fig-autocomplete
cd fig-autocomplete

# Add withfig/autocomplete as a remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete.git

# Install packages
npm install

# Create an example spec (call it "abc")
npm run create-spec abc

# Turn on "dev mode"
npm run dev
```

3. Now go to your terminal and type `abc[space]`. Your example spec will appear. üòä

#### Other things to know

- Edit your spec in typescript in the `src/` folder
- On save, specs are compiled to the `build/` folder
- In **dev mode** specs are read from the `build` folders. Otherwise they are read from `~/.fig/autocomplete`

<br/>

## üì¶ Other available package.json commands

```bash

# Typecheck all specs in the src/ folder
npm test

# Compile typescripts specs from src/ folder to build/ folder
npm run build

# Copy all specs from the build/ folder to the ~/.fig/autocomplete folder
npm run copy:all

# Copy an individual spec from the build/ folder to the ~/.fig/autocomplete folder
npm run copy <spec-name>
```
