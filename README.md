# Visual Autocomplete For your Terminal
[Fig](https://withfig.com?ref=github_autocomplete) adds apps, shortcuts, and autocomplete to your Terminal. <br />

**Note**: We currently only work on iTerm2 and the native Terminal on macOS.

### Installation
1. Make sure you have Fig (version 1.0.20 or above) installed. We are currently in private beta. Sign up to our waitlist here: [https://withfig.com](https://withfig.com?ref=github_autocomplete)

2. Install the completion specs to your local device

```bash
fig update
```

3. In the Mac status bar (top right corner of the screen), click the Fig icon, and make sure *Autocomplete* is selected. If Autocomplete ever stops working, just toggle this button.
