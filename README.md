**[Fig](https://fig.io?ref=github_autocomplete) adds autocomplete to your terminal.** 

As you type, Fig pops up subcommands, options, and contextually relevant arguments in your existing terminal on macOS.

<br/>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

* **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)**: `brew install fig`
* **Manual**: Download the macOS app at [fig.io](https://fig.io/download)
<br/>

## üëã What are "completion specs"?

A completion spec is a _declarative_ schema that specifies the `subcommands`, `options` and `arguments` for a CLI tool. We use these schemas to generate suggestions. 


<br/>


## üòé Contribute your first spec in < 3 minutes

Use the steps below or follow our getting started guide: [fig.io/docs](https://fig.io/docs)

**Prerequisites:**

- Download Fig for macOS
- Node and NPM (or Yarn).

<br/>

**Steps**

1. Click [here](https://GitHub.com/withfig/autocomplete/fork/) to fork this repo.

2. Clone your forked repo and create an example spec

```bash
# Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your own github username
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/autocomplete.git fig-autocomplete
cd fig-autocomplete

# Add withfig/autocomplete as a remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete.git

# Install packages
npm install

# Create an example spec (call it "abc")
npm run create-spec abc

# Turn on "dev mode"
npm run dev
```

3. Now go to your terminal and type `abc[space]`. Your example spec will appear. üòä

#### Other things to know

- Edit your spec in typescript in the `src/` folder
- On save, specs are compiled to the `build/` folder
- In **dev mode** specs are read from the `build` folders. 

<br/>

## üì¶ Other available package.json commands

```bash

# Typecheck all specs in the src/ folder
npm test

# Compile typescripts specs from src/ folder to build/ folder
npm run build

# Copy all specs from the build/ folder to the ~/.fig/autocomplete folder
npm run copy:all

# Copy an individual spec from the build/ folder to the ~/.fig/autocomplete folder
npm run copy <spec-name>
```

## üî• Contributions
We would love contributions for:
* new completion specs 
* errors with existing completion specs (e.g. missing subcomannds, options, or arguments)
* [generators](https://fig.io/docs/getting-started/generating-argument-suggestions) for argument suggestions
* better descriptions, icons etc
* [themes](https://github.com/withfig/themes)!

If you aren't able to contribute, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete/issues/new/choose). Most people think that contributing will be too hard, but you'd be surprised, we have deliberately made contributing very very easy. Give it a go!

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è FAQ

#### What terminals does Fig work with?

Fig works with the native MacOS Terminal app, [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/), [Tabby](https://tabby.sh), [Hyper](https://hyper.is) and the [integrated terminal in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal). We are adding support for Alacritty, Kitty, and the integrated terminals in JetBrains very soon. 

#### How does Fig work?

Fig uses the Accessibility API on Mac to position the window, insert text on your behalf, and read what you've typed in your terminal.

Currently, Fig is only available on MacOS.

#### How can I download Fig?

Run `brew install fig` or by downloading the app at [fig.io/download](https://fig.io/download).

#### Can I use Fig to build autocomplete for my team's internal scripts and CLI tools?

Yes! Check out our guide on how to [get started building autocomplete specs](https://fig.io/docs/getting-started).

#### How do I submit a PR?
