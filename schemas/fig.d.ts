     * The suggestions remain the same while the filteredSuggestions change on each input.
     *
     * Typically, Fig regenerates the suggestions every time the user hits space as in bash, a space typically delimits commands. However, if the `trigger` prop is defined, Fig will run the trigger function on each keystroke. If it returns true, instead of filtering over the suggestions, Fig will regenerate the list of suggestions THEN filter over them.
     * The trigger function takes two inputs: the new token the user typed and the token on the keystroke before.
     *
     * Trigger as a function takes two arguments: 1. the new token 2. the old token
     * e.g. the old token might be `desktop` and the new token might be `desktop/`. The function may look for a different in the number of slashes. In this case there is a difference so it would return true.
     *
     * The trigger prop can also be a simple string. This is syntactic sugar that allows you to specify a single character. If count of this character in the string before !== the count of the new string, Fig will regenerate the suggestions.
     *
     * Using a trigger is especially beneficial when you have an argument contained inside a single string that is not separated by a space. It is often used with a custom prop or script (as a function)

     *
     * @example
     * You can see the trigger in action every time you use file and folder completions (e.g. with `cd`). When you type a `/`, Fig will regenerate its list of file and folder suggestions by appending the path of what you've already typed to your current working directory.
     * e.g. If I had already typed "desktop". The current list of suggestions is from the ~ directory and the filterTerm is "desktop".
