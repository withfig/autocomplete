Hello @${danger.github.pr.user.login}, 
thank you very much for creating a Pull Request!
Here is a small checklist to get this PR merged as quickly as possible:

- [ ] Do all subcommands / options which take arguments have the arg property (\`arg: {}\`)?
- [ ] Are all options modular? E.g. \`a\` \`-u\` \`-x\` instead of \`-aux\`
- [ ] Have all other checks passed?

Please add a üëç  as a reaction to this comment to show that you read this.`,
    });
  }
});
