   * - For very very large specs (e.g. aws or gcloud) where loading the full completion spec would be slow. Instead, we load up the list of subcommands then dynamically load up the sub-subcommands using `loadSpec`.
   * - For CLI tools that take a command as an argument e.g. `time <cmd>` or `builtin <cmd>`. `loadSpec` will load up the completion spec for the CLI the user inputs. e.g. if the user export types `time git` we should load up the git spec
   * - For CLI tools that take a local script as an argument e.g. `python <script>` or `node <script>`. `loadSpec` will load up the completion spec for the script the user inputs. e.g. if the user export types `python main.py` we should load up the main.py completion spec.
   * - For CLI tools that have modules that function like their own CLI tools. e.g. `python -m <module>`. LoadSpec will load up the completion spec for the module e.g. the `http.server` completion spec
   *
   * **The `SpecLocation` Object**
   *
   * The SpecLocation object defines well... the location of the completion spec we want to load.
   * Specs can be "global" (ie hosted by Fig's cloud) or "local" (ie stored on your local machine).
   *
   * - Global `SpecLocation`:
   * Load specs hosted in Fig's Cloud. Assume the current working directory is here: https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete/tree/master/src. Now set the value for the "name" prop to the relative location of your spec (without the .js file extension)
   * ```js
   * // e.g.
   * { export type: "global", name: "aws/s3" } // Loads up the aws s3 completion spec
   * { export type: "global", name: "python/http.server" } // Loads up the http.server completion spec
   * ```
   *
   * - Local `SpecLocation`:
   * Load specs saved on your local system / machine. Assume the current working directory is the user's current working directory.
   * The `name` prop should take the name of the spec (without the .js file extension) e.g. my_cli_tool
   * The `path` prop should take an absolute path OR a relative path (relative to the user's current working directory). The path should be to the directory that contains the `.fig` folder. Fig will then assume your spec is located in `.fig/autocomplete/build/`
   * ```js
   * // e.g.
   * { export type: "global", path: "node_modules/cowsay", name: "cowsay_cli" }  // will look for `cwd/node_modules/cowsay/.fig/autocomplete/build/cowsay_cli.js`
   * { export type: "global", path: "~", name: "my_cli" }  // will look for `~/.fig/autocomplete/build/my_cli.js`
   * ```
   *
   * **Syntactic Sugars**
   *
   * We have three bits of syntactic sugar that can make this easier:
   * 1. Pass a single string to `loadSpec` instead of a function. We interpret this string as the "name" prop of global SpecLocation object
   * ```js
   * // e.g.
   * loadSpec: python/http.server
   * // compiles to
   * { export type: "global", name: "python/http.server" }
   * ```
   * 2. `isCommand` (See [Arg Object](https://fig.io/docs/reference/arg#iscommand)).
   * 3. `isScript` (See [Arg Object](https://fig.io/docs/reference/arg#isscript)).

   * A function run on every keystroke that determines whether Fig should invalidate its cached list of suggestions and instead regenerate its list of suggestions.

   * A note on how Fig works: Suggestions vs Filtered Suggestions
   * Suggestions: Whenever you export type a space indicating the start of a new token, Fig will regenerate a new list of suggestions e.g. `git[space]` will generate a list of suggestions for every subcommand, option, and arg
   * Filtered Suggestions: When you export type within the same token (e.g. `git c` -> `git ch`), Fig takes the token you are currently typing in and uses it to filter over the list of suggestions you have cached. e.g. `git c`. The list of suggestions is the same as before, but the filtered suggestions are now `commit`, `clean`, `clone`, and `checkout`.
   *
   * **Why don't we recalculate suggestions on each keystroke?**
   * 1. It's expensive
   * 2. We don't need to. The caching works nicely
   *
   * **So what does the trigger do?**
   * The trigger function is run on every keystroke and tells us whether or not we should invalidate the cache and regenerate a list of suggestions.
   * The trigger function is almost always used with a `custom` generator and the `getQueryTerm` function to make the autocomplete experience really good (it's how suggestions for `cd` work)
   * It is especially beneficial when you want to generate suggestions for an argument contained inside a single string that is not separated by a space.
   *
   * **What is important to remember?**
   * This function looks at the CHANGE in a token, not the current state of the token. If my token goes from `desktop` to `desktop/`, should I regenerate suggestions? Remember, users can paste text so theoretically any change is possible. It is totally valid for oldToken to be an empty string and newToken to be a 50 character string!
   *
   * @param newToken - The new token that was just export typed by the user e.g. "desktop/""
   * @param oldToken - The old token that was there before e.g. "desktop"
   * @returns A boolean of whether or not we should regenerate suggestions
   *
   * @defaultValue
   * `false`
   * It means that the function returns false ie we do not regenerate suggestion on each keystroke and instead, keep our cached list of suggestions while the user is editing the current token.
   *
   * @example
   * `chmod`: If I export type `chmod u` we should generate suggestions for `u+x`, `u+r`, `u-w` etc. Whereas if I export typed `chmod 7` we should generate suggestions for `755` or `777` etc.
   * The suggestion we generate depends on the new information we have. The oldToken was an empty string, the new token could be a `7` or a `u` etc...
   *
   *   All this function's job is to say whether or not we should generate new suggestions. It does not specify how to create these new suggestions. This is the job of the `script` or `custom` props. Annoyingly, you may have to implement some of the same parsing logic again. However, because this is javascript, just create a function so you don't have to repeat yourself :)
   *
   *   Note: yes, we could have generate a list of suggestions at the start for every single permutation of 777 or u+x etc, however, there are so many and this is just not performant!
   *
   * @example
   * `cd`: Let's say a user has "cd desktop" currently export typed then the user export types a "/" so the changes to "cd ~/desktop/".
   * The old token is "~/desktop", new token is "desktop/". This is a perfect time for us to generate a new list of suggestions. We previously had all the folders in my ~ directory as suggestions, but after the total number of `/` in the tokens changed, we shoudl trigger a new set of suggestions to be generated. This new set of suggestions should then generate suggestions for the desktop directory, not the ~ directory.

   * @example
   * In `cd` the custom function will combine the current working directory with everything up to the last `"/"` in the last token. It will then run `ls` at this path and generate a list of suggestions accordingly.
