        "Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status PLACING, where a new game session is created for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to CANCELLED, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.  To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information.  When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to UTILIZED (using UpdateGameServer) once players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable. If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:   If the game server utilization status is UTILIZED.   If the game server claim status is CLAIMED.    When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in DRAINING status.

Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.

        "Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance. Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location. To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations. If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in NEW status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the fleet creation workflow. You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using DescribeFleetAttributes and DescribeFleetLocationAttributes/, or by monitoring fleet creation events using DescribeFleetEvents. As soon as the fleet status changes to ACTIVE, you can enable automatic scaling for the fleet with PutScalingPolicy and set capacity for the home Region with UpdateFleetCapacity. When the status of each remote location reaches ACTIVE, you can set capacity by location using UpdateFleetCapacity.

Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch. Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:    An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see  Launching an Instance from a Launch Template in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.    An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction in the GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide.   To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric. Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group.

        "Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.  A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types, and AWS Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed. The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide an alternate set of priorities. To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations. Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity. If successful, a new GameSessionQueue object is returned with an assigned queue ARN. New game session requests, which are submitted to the queue with StartGameSessionPlacement or StartMatchmaking, reference a queue's name or ARN.

Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location, that your AWS account can use. Learn more at Amazon EC2 Instance Types. The information returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect your ability to scale your GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your account by using the Service limits page in the GameLift console. Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an AWS Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all return different results:    Request specifies the Region ap-northeast-1 with no location. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in us-east-2, by all of the fleets that reside in ap-northeast-1.    Request specifies the Region us-east-1 with location ca-central-1. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in ca-central-1, by all of the fleets that reside in us-east-2. These limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions that deploy instances to ca-central-1.   Request specifies the Region eu-west-1 with location ca-central-1. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in ca-central-1, by all of the fleets that reside in eu-west-1.   This operation can be used in the following ways:   To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed in an AWS Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify the Region only. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.   To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed to a remote location by fleets that reside in different AWS Region: Provide both the AWS Region and the remote location. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.   If successful, an EC2InstanceLimits object is returned with limits and usage data for each requested instance type.

      description:
        "Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\" A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations.  This operation can be used in the following ways:    To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.   To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any remote location.   Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.  If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions. You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:    gameSessionId -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- Custom data defined in a game session's GameProperty parameter. GameProperty values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair \"gameMode:brawl\", specify the following: gameSessionProperties.gameMode = \"brawl\". All custom data values are searched as strings.    maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.

When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request. When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.  To place a new game session request, specify the following:   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request   (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)   If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status. If the status is FULFILLED, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.

Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.  When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a GameSession identifier. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the GameSession resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request. When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled. To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled.

For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.  Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies for use in the future. For multi-location fleets, you can set up fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations.  This operation can be used in the following ways:    To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.    To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend.    If successful, GameLift no longer initiates scaling events except in response to manual changes using UpdateFleetCapacity. You can view a fleet's stopped actions using DescribeFleetAttributes or DescribeFleetLocationAttributes. Suspended activity can be restarted using StartFleetActions.

        "Updates capacity settings for a fleet. For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that can be hosted based on the fleet configuration. Use this operation to set the following fleet capacity properties:    Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on fleet capacity. GameLift cannot set the fleet's capacity to a value outside of this range, whether the capacity is changed manually or through automatic scaling.    Desired capacity: Manually set the number of EC2 instances to be maintained in a fleet location. Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, you may want to call DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get the maximum capacity of the fleet's EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand.   This operation can be used in the following ways:    To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must be in ACTIVE status.    To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, include the Location parameter set to the location to be updated. The location must be in ACTIVE status.   If successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a change in desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location's active instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current capacity by calling DescribeFleetCapacity or DescribeFleetLocationCapacity. If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit, the LimitExceeded exception occurs.

Updates information about a registered game server to help GameLift FleetIQ to track game server availability. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group.  Use this operation to update the following types of game server information. You can make all three types of updates in the same request:   To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game server and game server group and specify the current utilization status. Use this status to identify when game servers are currently hosting games and when they are available to be claimed.   To report health status, identify the game server and game server group and set health check to HEALTHY. If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds.   To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.   Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated.
