Route 53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone and automatically updates your domain registration with the names of these name servers.   Enables autorenew, so your domain registration will renew automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so you can choose whether to renew the registration.   Optionally enables privacy protection, so WHOIS queries return contact information either for Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or for our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs). If you don't enable privacy protection, WHOIS queries return the information that you entered for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts.   If registration is successful, returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the request is not completed successfully, the domain registrant is notified by email.   Charges your AWS account an amount based on the top-level domain.
