    "AWS Directory Service AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed information about AWS Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about AWS Directory Services features, see AWS Directory Service and the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Directory Service and other AWS services.
