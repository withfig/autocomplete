If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme.

        "Describes the customizations associated with the provided AWS account and Amazon QuickSight namespace in an AWS Region. The QuickSight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the Resolved flag included.  To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved.     AWS Account - The AWS account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the AWS Regions and AWS Services. When you subscribe to QuickSight, you choose one AWS Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use QuickSight in any supported AWS Region.     AWS Region - In each AWS Region where you sign in to QuickSight at least once, QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to QuickSight in any AWS Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace.  To run the command in a different AWS Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the AWS CLI, you can use one of the following options:   Use command line options.    Use named profiles.    Run aws configure to change your default AWS Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information, see Configuring the AWS CLI.      Namespace - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same AWS account and AWS Region.    Applied customizations - Within an AWS Region, a set of QuickSight customizations can apply to an AWS account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an AWS account. All settings are isolated to a single AWS Region. To apply them in other AWS Regions, run the CreateAccountCustomization command in each AWS Region where you want to apply the same customizations",

Currently, you need to create the profile names for custom permission sets by using the QuickSight console. Then, you use the RegisterUser API operation to assign the named set of permissions to a QuickSight user.  QuickSight custom permissions are applied through IAM policies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by assigning QuickSight users to one of the default security cohorts in QuickSight (admin, author, reader).
