The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.  An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the CreateHITType operation and then call the CreateHITWithHITType operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.  CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the Question parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a HitLayoutId and associated HitLayoutParameters.
