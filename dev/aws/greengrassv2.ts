    "AWS IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to the AWS Cloud. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation. AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage deployments, and core devices.

For example, this occurs if component A requires version &gt;2.0.0 and component B requires version &lt;2.0.0 of a component dependency. When you specify the component candidates to resolve, AWS IoT Greengrass compares each component's digest from the core device with the component's digest in the AWS Cloud. If the digests don't match, then AWS IoT Greengrass specifies to use the version from the AWS Cloud.  To use this operation, you must use the data plane API endpoint and authenticate with an AWS IoT device certificate. For more information, see AWS IoT Greengrass endpoints and quotas",
