AWS Cloud9 supports these operations:    CreateEnvironmentEC2: Creates an AWS Cloud9 development environment, launches an Amazon EC2 instance, and then connects from the instance to the environment.    CreateEnvironmentMembership: Adds an environment member to an environment.    DeleteEnvironment: Deletes an environment. If an Amazon EC2 instance is connected to the environment, also terminates the instance.    DeleteEnvironmentMembership: Deletes an environment member from an environment.    DescribeEnvironmentMemberships: Gets information about environment members for an environment.    DescribeEnvironments: Gets information about environments.    DescribeEnvironmentStatus: Gets status information for an environment.    ListEnvironments: Gets a list of environment identifiers.    ListTagsForResource: Gets the tags for an environment.    TagResource: Adds tags to an environment.    UntagResource: Removes tags from an environment.    UpdateEnvironment: Changes the settings of an existing environment.
