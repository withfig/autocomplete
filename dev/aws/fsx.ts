You periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your AWS partition.  You can also use backup copies to clone your file data set to another Region or within the same Region. You can use the SourceRegion parameter to specify the AWS Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the us-west-1 Region and want to copy a backup from the us-east-2 Region, you specify us-east-2 in the SourceRegion parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.
