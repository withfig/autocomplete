The ICE component uses this configuration information to setup the WebRTC connection, including authenticating with the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) relay server.  TURN is a protocol that is used to improve the connectivity of peer-to-peer applications. By providing a cloud-based relay service, TURN ensures that a connection can be established even when one or more peers are incapable of a direct peer-to-peer connection. For more information, see A REST API For Access To TURN Services.  You can invoke this API to establish a fallback mechanism in case either of the peers is unable to establish a direct peer-to-peer connection over a signaling channel. You must specify either a signaling channel ARN or the client ID in order to invoke this API",
