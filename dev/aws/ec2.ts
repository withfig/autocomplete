    "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and used like a hard drive.

After creating the set, you must associate it with the VPC, causing all existing and new instances that you launch in the VPC to use this set of DHCP options. The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information about the options, see RFC 2132.    domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name, you must set domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.    domain-name - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in us-east-1, specify ec2.internal. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another Region, specify region.compute.internal (for example, ap-northeast-1.compute.internal). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, ExampleCompany.com). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Important: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one domain name.    ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.    netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.    netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more information about these node types, see RFC 2132.   Your VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only a DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). If you create a set of options, and if your VPC has an internet gateway, make sure to set the domain-name-servers option either to AmazonProvidedDNS or to a domain name server of your choice.

If you create a snapshot of a volume on an Outpost, the snapshot can be stored on the same Outpost as the volume, or in the Region for that Outpost. When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot. You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending. To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot. Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected. You can tag your snapshots during creation.

A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:    default - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other AWS accounts.    dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single AWS account.      state - The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can be in one of the following states:    active- The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is available for your use.    expired - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at the date and time specified in your request. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.    cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.    pending - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the capacity provisioning is still pending.    failed - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.      start-date - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.    end-date - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.    end-date-type - Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends.

The options include:    open - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.    targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation.

The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other AWS accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions. The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:    public: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the all group. All AWS accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.    explicit: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific AWS account.    implicit: An AWS account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.   The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or AWS accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions. If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results. If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the AWS account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by Amazon, or self for snapshots that you own. If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify AWS account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public snapshots. If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The MaxResults parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subsequent DescribeSnapshots request to retrieve the remaining results. To get the state of fast snapshot restores for a snapshot, use DescribeFastSnapshotRestores.

The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:  Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks might still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see Monitoring the status of your volumes in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.  Actions: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency. Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)",

For more information, see EC2Config and EC2Launch in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For the EC2Config service, the password is not generated for rebundled AMIs unless Ec2SetPassword is enabled before bundling. The password is encrypted using the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance. You must provide the corresponding key pair file. When you launch an instance, password generation and encryption may take a few minutes. If you try to retrieve the password before it's available, the output returns an empty string.

For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Linux, see Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Linux. For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Windows, see Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Windows.  When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For information about extending a Linux file system, see Extending a Linux file system. For information about extending a Windows file system, see Extending a Windows file system.   You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. You can also track the status of a modification using DescribeVolumesModifications. For information about tracking status changes using either method, see Monitoring volume modifications.  With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance. For more information, see Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes (Linux) or Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes (Windows).

For more information about creating AMIs, see Creating your own AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  For Amazon EBS-backed instances, CreateImage creates and registers the AMI in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI yourself.  If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.  Register a snapshot of a root device volume  You can use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched from the AMI is encrypted. For more information, see Create a Linux AMI from a snapshot and Use encryption with EBS-backed AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  AWS Marketplace product codes  If any snapshots have AWS Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI. Windows and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the EC2 billing product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status for package updates. To create a new AMI for operating systems that require a billing product code, instead of registering the AMI, do the following to preserve the billing product code association:   Launch an instance from an existing AMI with that billing product code.   Customize the instance.   Create an AMI from the instance using CreateImage.   If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand Instance. For information about how to obtain the platform details and billing information of an AMI, see Obtaining billing information in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.",

You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet. By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application workload. Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet. You can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched by the fleet. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the spot-fleet-request and instance resource types are supported.

For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see Instance lifecycle in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while.

Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.    type - The type of Spot Instance request (one-time | persistent).    valid-from - The start date of the request.    valid-until - The end date of the request.",
