    "Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private servers), container services, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly price. You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the Lightsail Dev Guide. This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service, see Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and Quotas in the AWS General Reference",

You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending. You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the instance name parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk. The create disk snapshot operation supports tag-based access control via request tags. For more information, see the Lightsail Dev Guide",

Valid instance metric names are listed below, along with the most useful statistics to include in your request, and the published unit value.     BurstCapacityPercentage  - The percentage of CPU performance available for your instance to burst above its baseline. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage reaches 100%. For more information, see Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Percent.     BurstCapacityTime  - The available amount of time for your instance to burst at 100% CPU utilization. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity time stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage metric reaches 100%. Burst capacity time is consumed at the full rate only when your instance operates at 100% CPU utilization. For example, if your instance operates at 50% CPU utilization in the burstable zone for a 5-minute period, then it consumes CPU burst capacity minutes at a 50% rate in that period. Your instance consumed 2 minutes and 30 seconds of CPU burst capacity minutes in the 5-minute period. For more information, see Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Seconds.     CPUUtilization  - The percentage of allocated compute units that are currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the processing power to run the applications on the instance. Tools in your operating system can show a lower percentage than Lightsail when the instance is not allocated a full processor core.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Percent.     NetworkIn  - The number of bytes received on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes.     NetworkOut  - The number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes sent during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes.

HTTPCode_Instance_5XX_Count  - The number of HTTP 5XX response codes generated by the target instances. This does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     HTTPCode_LB_4XX_Count  - The number of HTTP 4XX client error codes that originated from the load balancer. Client errors are generated when requests are malformed or incomplete. These requests were not received by the target instance. This count does not include response codes generated by the target instances.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     HTTPCode_LB_5XX_Count  - The number of HTTP 5XX server error codes that originated from the load balancer. This does not include any response codes generated by the target instance. This metric is reported if there are no healthy instances attached to the load balancer, or if the request rate exceeds the capacity of the instances (spillover) or the load balancer.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     InstanceResponseTime  - The time elapsed, in seconds, after the request leaves the load balancer until a response from the target instance is received.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Average.  Unit: The published unit is Seconds.     RejectedConnectionCount  - The number of connections that were rejected because the load balancer had reached its maximum number of connections.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     RequestCount  - The number of requests processed over IPv4. This count includes only the requests with a response generated by a target instance of the load balancer.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Note that Minimum, Maximum, and Average all return 1.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     UnhealthyHostCount  - The number of target instances that are considered unhealthy.
