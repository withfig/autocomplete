To view the available tables and columns, see the Data Exports table dictionary. The TableConfigurations is a collection of specified TableProperties for the table being queried in the QueryStatement. TableProperties are additional configurations you can provide to change the data and schema of a table. Each table can have different TableProperties. However, tables are not required to have any TableProperties. Each table property has a default value that it assumes if not specified. For more information on table configurations, see Data query.
