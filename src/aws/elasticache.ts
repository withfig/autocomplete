    "Amazon ElastiCache Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud. With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment. In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot",

When you add or remove tags on replication groups, those actions will be replicated to all nodes in the replication group. For more information, see Resource-level permissions.  For example, you can use cost-allocation tags to your ElastiCache resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services.

        "Creates a Redis (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. This API can be used to create a standalone regional replication group or a secondary replication group associated with a Global datastore. A Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group is a collection of clusters, where one of the clusters is a read/write primary and the others are read-only replicas. Writes to the primary are asynchronously propagated to the replicas. A Redis cluster-mode enabled cluster is comprised of from 1 to 90 shards (API/CLI: node groups). Each shard has a primary node and up to 5 read-only replica nodes. The configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number or replicas allowed.  The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the Redis engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. For example, you can choose to configure a 500 node cluster that ranges between 83 shards (one primary and 5 replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single primary and no replicas). Make sure there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase. Common pitfalls include the subnets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or the subnets are shared and heavily used by other clusters. For more information, see Creating a Subnet Group. For versions below 5.0.6, the limit is 250 per cluster. To request a limit increase, see AWS Service Limits and choose the limit type Nodes per cluster per instance type.  When a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group has been successfully created, you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a total of 5 read replicas. If you need to increase or decrease the number of node groups (console: shards), you can avail yourself of ElastiCache for Redis' scaling. For more information, see Scaling ElastiCache for Redis Clusters in the ElastiCache User Guide.  This operation is valid for Redis only",

If the value is less than the number of existing cache nodes, nodes are removed. If the value is equal to the number of current cache nodes, any pending add or remove requests are canceled. If you are removing cache nodes, you must use the CacheNodeIdsToRemove parameter to provide the IDs of the specific cache nodes to remove. For clusters running Redis, this value must be 1. For clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 40.  Adding or removing Memcached cache nodes can be applied immediately or as a pending operation (see ApplyImmediately). A pending operation to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster during its maintenance window, whether by adding or removing nodes in accordance with the scale out architecture, is not queued. The customer's latest request to add or remove nodes to the cluster overrides any previous pending operations to modify the number of cache nodes in the cluster. For example, a request to remove 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes. Similarly, a request to add 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes and vice versa. As Memcached cache nodes may now be provisioned in different Availability Zones with flexible cache node placement, a request to add nodes does not automatically override a previous pending operation to add nodes. The customer can modify the previous pending operation to add more nodes or explicitly cancel the pending request and retry the new request.
