If you need to archive any user data, contact AWS Support before terminating the WorkSpace.  You can terminate a WorkSpace that is in any state except SUSPENDED. This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely terminated. After a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state is returned only briefly before the WorkSpace directory metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned. To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the WorkSpace ID by using  DescribeWorkSpaces. If the WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been successfully terminated.  Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of charge to use with WorkSpaces. If there are no WorkSpaces being used with your Simple AD or AD Connector directory for 30 consecutive days, this directory will be automatically deregistered for use with Amazon WorkSpaces, and you will be charged for this directory as per the AWS Directory Services pricing terms. To delete empty directories, see  Delete the Directory for Your WorkSpaces.
