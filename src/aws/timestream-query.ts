Using the same NextToken will return the same set of records. To keep paginating through the result set, you must to use the most recent nextToken.   Suppose a Query invocation returns two NextToken values, TokenA and TokenB. If TokenB is used in a subsequent Query invocation, then TokenA is invalidated and cannot be reused.   To request a previous result set from a query after pagination has begun, you must re-invoke the Query API.
