GetSparqlStream lets you collect these change-log entries for an RDF graph. The Neptune streams feature needs to be enabled on your Neptune DBcluster. To enable streams, set the neptune_streams DB cluster parameter to 1. See Capturing graph changes in real time using Neptune streams. When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request must have a policy attached that allows the neptune-db:GetStreamRecords IAM action in that cluster. Note that the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Sparql IAM condition key can be used in the policy document to restrict the use of SPARQL queries (see Condition keys available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements)",
