You can use both the original DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API operation and DescribeTrafficSources on the same Auto Scaling group.  Gets information about the Elastic Load Balancing target groups for the specified Auto Scaling group. To determine the attachment status of the target group, use the State element in the response. When you attach a target group to an Auto Scaling group, the initial State value is Adding. The state transitions to Added after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the target group. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the Auto Scaling group, the state transitions to InService after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the target group is in the InService state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy. If no registered instances pass the health checks, the target group doesn't enter the InService state.  Target groups also have an InService state if you attach them in the CreateAutoScalingGroup API call. If your target group state is InService, but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities by calling DescribeScalingActivities and take any corrective actions necessary. For help with failed health checks, see Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Health checks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. For more information, see Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

        "This API operation is superseded by DescribeTrafficSources, which can describe multiple traffic sources types. We recommend using DescribeTrafficSources to simplify how you manage traffic sources. However, we continue to support DescribeLoadBalancers. You can use both the original DescribeLoadBalancers API operation and DescribeTrafficSources on the same Auto Scaling group.  Gets information about the load balancers for the specified Auto Scaling group. This operation describes only Classic Load Balancers. If you have Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Gateway Load Balancers, use the DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API instead. To determine the attachment status of the load balancer, use the State element in the response. When you attach a load balancer to an Auto Scaling group, the initial State value is Adding. The state transitions to Added after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the load balancer. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the Auto Scaling group, the state transitions to InService after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the load balancer is in the InService state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy. If no registered instances pass the health checks, the load balancer doesn't enter the InService state.  Load balancers also have an InService state if you attach them in the CreateAutoScalingGroup API call. If your load balancer state is InService, but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities by calling DescribeScalingActivities and take any corrective actions necessary. For help with failed health checks, see Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Health checks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. For more information, see Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide",

Lifecycle hooks let you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs. This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:   (Optional) Create a launch template or launch configuration with a user data script that runs while an instance is in a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.   (Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows Amazon EventBridge to invoke your Lambda function when an instance is put into a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.   (Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target.    Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.    If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a wait state using the RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat API call.   If you finish before the timeout period ends, send a callback by using the CompleteLifecycleAction API call.   For more information, see Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group. To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the property that you want to change. Any properties that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns.  If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application. Note the following about changing DesiredCapacity, MaxSize, or MinSize:   If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new DesiredCapacity value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.   If you specify a new value for MinSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MinSize is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MinSize value.   If you specify a new value for MaxSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MaxSize is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MaxSize value.   To see which properties have been set, call the DescribeAutoScalingGroups API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the DescribePolicies API.
