A lifecycle hook tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to perform an action on an instance when the instance launches (before it is put into service) or as the instance terminates (before it is fully terminated). This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:   (Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows CloudWatch Events to invoke your Lambda function when Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches or terminates instances.   (Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target.    Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.    If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a pending state using the RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat API call.   If you finish before the timeout period ends, complete the lifecycle action using the CompleteLifecycleAction API call.   For more information, see Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. If you exceed your maximum limit of lifecycle hooks, which by default is 50 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails.

Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group. To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the parameter that you want to change. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns.  If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application. Note the following about changing DesiredCapacity, MaxSize, or MinSize:   If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new DesiredCapacity value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.   If you specify a new value for MinSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MinSize is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MinSize value.   If you specify a new value for MaxSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MaxSize is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MaxSize value.   To see which parameters have been set, call the DescribeAutoScalingGroups API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the DescribePolicies API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them by calling the PutScalingPolicy API",
