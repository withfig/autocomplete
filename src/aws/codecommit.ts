    "AWS CodeCommit This is the AWS CodeCommit API Reference. This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data types for AWS CodeCommit API along with usage examples. You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects: Repositories, by calling the following:    BatchGetRepositories, which returns information about one or more repositories associated with your AWS account.    CreateRepository, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository.    DeleteRepository, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository.    GetRepository, which returns information about a specified repository.    ListRepositories, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories associated with your AWS account.    UpdateRepositoryDescription, which sets or updates the description of the repository.    UpdateRepositoryName, which changes the name of the repository. If you change the name of a repository, no other users of that repository can access it until you send them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.   Branches, by calling the following:    CreateBranch, which creates a branch in a specified repository.    DeleteBranch, which deletes the specified branch in a repository unless it is the default branch.    GetBranch, which returns information about a specified branch.

Files, by calling the following:    DeleteFile, which deletes the content of a specified file from a specified branch.    GetBlob, which returns the base-64 encoded content of an individual Git blob object in a repository.    GetFile, which returns the base-64 encoded content of a specified file.

Commits, by calling the following:    BatchGetCommits, which returns information about one or more commits in a repository.    CreateCommit, which creates a commit for changes to a repository.    GetCommit, which returns information about a commit, including commit messages and author and committer information.    GetDifferences, which returns information about the differences in a valid commit specifier (such as a branch, tag, HEAD, commit ID, or other fully qualified reference).   Merges, by calling the following:    BatchDescribeMergeConflicts, which returns information about conflicts in a merge between commits in a repository.    CreateUnreferencedMergeCommit, which creates an unreferenced commit between two branches or commits for the purpose of comparing them and identifying any potential conflicts.    DescribeMergeConflicts, which returns information about merge conflicts between the base, source, and destination versions of a file in a potential merge.    GetMergeCommit, which returns information about the merge between a source and destination commit.

GetMergeOptions, which returns information about the available merge options between two branches or commit specifiers.    MergeBranchesByFastForward, which merges two branches using the fast-forward merge option.    MergeBranchesBySquash, which merges two branches using the squash merge option.

GetPullRequestApprovalStates, which returns information about the approval states for a specified pull request.    GetPullRequestOverrideState, which returns information about whether approval rules have been set aside (overriden) for a pull request, and if so, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user or identity that overrode the rules and their requirements for the pull request.    ListPullRequests, which lists all pull requests for a repository.    MergePullRequestByFastForward, which merges the source destination branch of a pull request into the specified destination branch for that pull request using the fast-forward merge option.    MergePullRequestBySquash, which merges the source destination branch of a pull request into the specified destination branch for that pull request using the squash merge option.    MergePullRequestByThreeWay. which merges the source destination branch of a pull request into the specified destination branch for that pull request using the three-way merge option.

After the template is associated with a repository, AWS CodeCommit creates approval rules that match the template conditions on every pull request created in the specified repositories.

PutCommentReaction, which creates or updates an emoji reaction to a comment.    UpdateComment, which updates the content of a comment on a commit in a repository.   Tags used to tag resources in AWS CodeCommit (not Git tags), by calling the following:    ListTagsForResource, which gets information about AWS tags for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeCommit.    TagResource, which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS CodeCommit.    UntagResource, which removes tags for a resource in AWS CodeCommit.

When you create the content of the approval rule template, you can specify approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:    CodeCommitApprovers: This option only requires an AWS account and a resource. It can be used for both IAM users and federated access users whose name matches the provided resource name. This is a very powerful option that offers a great deal of flexibility. For example, if you specify the AWS account 123456789012 and Mary_Major, all of the following are counted as approvals coming from that user:   An IAM user in the account (arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Mary_Major)   A federated user identified in IAM as Mary_Major (arn:aws:sts::123456789012:federated-user/Mary_Major)   This option does not recognize an active session of someone assuming the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name of Mary_Major (arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/Mary_Major) unless you include a wildcard (*Mary_Major).    Fully qualified ARN: This option allows you to specify the fully qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or role.
