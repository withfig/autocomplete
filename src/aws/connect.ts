    "Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at any scale. Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents. There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create. There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more information, see Amazon Connect Service Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. You can connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service by using an endpoint. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see Amazon Connect Endpoints",

You can call this API only in the same Amazon Web Services Region where the Amazon Connect instance or traffic distribution group was created. For more information about how to use this operation, see Claim a phone number in your country and Claim phone numbers to traffic distribution groups in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.   You can call the SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers API for available phone numbers that you can claim. Call the DescribePhoneNumber API to verify the status of a previous ClaimPhoneNumber operation.  If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently during a 30 day period, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming and releasing any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired. By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired.  For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket",

            'The contactId chosen for rehydration depends on the type chosen.    ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION: Rehydrates a chat from the most recently terminated past chat contact of the specified past ended chat session. To use this type, provide the initialContactId of the past ended chat session in the sourceContactId field. In this type, Amazon Connect determines what the most recent chat contact on the past ended chat session and uses it to start a persistent chat.     FROM_SEGMENT: Rehydrates a chat from the specified past chat contact provided in the sourceContactId field.    The actual contactId used for rehydration is provided in the response of this API. To illustrate how to use rehydration type, consider the following example: A customer starts a chat session. Agent a1 accepts the chat and a conversation starts between the customer and Agent a1. This first contact creates a contact ID C1. Agent a1 then transfers the chat to Agent a2. This creates another contact ID C2. At this point Agent a2 ends the chat. The customer is forwarded to the disconnect flow for a post chat survey that creates another contact ID C3. After the chat survey, the chat session ends. Later, the customer returns and wants to resume their past chat session. At this point, the customer can have following use cases:     Use Case 1: The customer wants to continue the past chat session but they want to hide the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:    Configuration    SourceContactId = "C2"   RehydrationType = "FROM_SEGMENT"      Expected behavior    This starts a persistent chat session from the specified past ended contact (C2). Transcripts of past chat sessions C2 and C1 are accessible in the current persistent chat session. Note that chat segment C3 is dropped from the persistent chat session.        Use Case 2: The customer wants to continue the past chat session and see the transcript of the entire past engagement, including the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:    Configuration    SourceContactId = "C1"   RehydrationType = "ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION"      Expected behavior    This starts a persistent chat session from the most recently ended chat contact (C3).

You can call this API only in the Amazon Web Services Region where the number was claimed.  To release phone numbers from a traffic distribution group, use the ReleasePhoneNumber API, not the Amazon Connect admin website. After releasing a phone number, the phone number enters into a cooldown period of 30 days. It cannot be searched for or claimed again until the period has ended. If you accidentally release a phone number, contact Amazon Web Services Support.  If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently during a 30 day period, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming and releasing any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired. By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired.  For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket",
