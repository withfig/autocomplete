A changeType can have the following values:    PUT \u2013 Adds or updates files in a database.   DELETE \u2013 Deletes files in a database.   All the change requests require a mandatory dbPath attribute that defines the path within the database directory. All database paths must start with a leading / and end with a trailing /. The s3Path attribute defines the s3 source file path and is required for a PUT change type. The s3path must end with a trailing / if it is a directory and must end without a trailing / if it is a file.  Here are few examples of how you can use the change request object:   This request adds a single sym file at database root location.   { "changeType": "PUT", "s3Path":"s3://bucket/db/sym", "dbPath":"/"}    This request adds files in the given s3Path under the 2020.01.02 partition of the database.  { "changeType": "PUT", "s3Path":"s3://bucket/db/2020.01.02/", "dbPath":"/2020.01.02/"}    This request adds files in the given s3Path under the taq table partition of the database.  [ { "changeType": "PUT", "s3Path":"s3://bucket/db/2020.01.02/taq/", "dbPath":"/2020.01.02/taq/"}]    This request deletes the 2020.01.02 partition of the database.  [{ "changeType": "DELETE", "dbPath": "/2020.01.02/"} ]    The DELETE request allows you to delete the existing files under the 2020.01.02 partition of the database, and the PUT request adds a new taq table under it.

This type of database captures all the data from a ticker plant and stores it in memory until the end of day, after which it writes all of its data to a disk and reloads the HDB. This cluster type requires local storage for temporary storage of data during the savedown process. If you specify this field in your request, you must provide the savedownStorageConfiguration parameter.   GATEWAY \u2013 A gateway cluster allows you to access data across processes in kdb systems. It allows you to create your own routing logic using the initialization scripts and custom code. This type of cluster does not require a writable local storage.   GP \u2013 A general purpose cluster allows you to quickly iterate on code during development by granting greater access to system commands and enabling a fast reload of custom code. This cluster type can optionally mount databases including cache and savedown storage. For this cluster type, the node count is fixed at 1. It does not support autoscaling and supports only SINGLE AZ mode.   Tickerplant \u2013 A tickerplant cluster allows you to subscribe to feed handlers based on IAM permissions.

This type of database captures all the data from a ticker plant and stores it in memory until the end of day, after which it writes all of its data to a disk and reloads the HDB. This cluster type requires local storage for temporary storage of data during the savedown process. If you specify this field in your request, you must provide the savedownStorageConfiguration parameter.   GATEWAY \u2013 A gateway cluster allows you to access data across processes in kdb systems. It allows you to create your own routing logic using the initialization scripts and custom code. This type of cluster does not require a writable local storage.   GP \u2013 A general purpose cluster allows you to quickly iterate on code during development by granting greater access to system commands and enabling a fast reload of custom code. This cluster type can optionally mount databases including cache and savedown storage. For this cluster type, the node count is fixed at 1. It does not support autoscaling and supports only SINGLE AZ mode.   Tickerplant \u2013 A tickerplant cluster allows you to subscribe to feed handlers based on IAM permissions. It can publish to RDBs, other Tickerplants, and real-time subscribers (RTS). Tickerplants can persist messages to log, which is readable by any RDB environment. It supports only single-node that is only one kdb process",
