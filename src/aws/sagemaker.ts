An AutoML job in SageMaker is a fully automated process that allows you to build machine learning models with minimal effort and machine learning expertise.

SageMaker then automates the entire model development lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, tuning, and evaluation. AutoML jobs are designed to simplify and accelerate the model building process by automating various tasks and exploring different combinations of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter values. The output of an AutoML job comprises one or more trained models ready for deployment and inference. Additionally, SageMaker AutoML jobs generate a candidate model leaderboard, allowing you to select the best-performing model for deployment.

A domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System volume, a list of authorized users, and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other.  EFS storage  When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files. SageMaker uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed key. For more information, see Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption.  VPC configuration  All traffic between the domain and the Amazon EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets. For other traffic, you can specify the AppNetworkAccessType parameter. AppNetworkAccessType corresponds to the network access type that you choose when you onboard to the domain. The following options are available:    PublicInternetOnly - Non-EFS traffic goes through a VPC managed by Amazon SageMaker, which allows internet access. This is the default value.    VpcOnly - All traffic is through the specified VPC and subnets. Internet access is disabled by default. To allow internet access, you must specify a NAT gateway. When internet access is disabled, you won't be able to run a Amazon SageMaker Studio notebook or to train or host models unless your VPC has an interface endpoint to the SageMaker API and runtime or a NAT gateway and your security groups allow outbound connections.    NFS traffic over TCP on port 2049 needs to be allowed in both inbound and outbound rules in order to launch a Amazon SageMaker Studio app successfully.

You create the endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API.   Use this API to deploy models using SageMaker hosting services.    You must not delete an EndpointConfig that is in use by an endpoint that is live or while the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new EndpointConfig.  The endpoint name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in your Amazon Web Services account.  When it receives the request, SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them.   When you call CreateEndpoint, a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting  Eventually Consistent Reads , the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call DescribeEndpointConfig before calling CreateEndpoint to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.  When SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Creating. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to InService. SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the DescribeEndpoint API. If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your Amazon Web Services account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide.   To add the IAM role policies for using this API operation, go to the IAM console, and choose Roles in the left navigation pane. Search the IAM role that you want to grant access to use the CreateEndpoint and CreateEndpointConfig API operations, add the following policies to the role.    Option 1: For a full SageMaker access, search and attach the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy.   Option 2: For granting a limited access to an IAM role, paste the following Action elements manually into the JSON file of the IAM role:   "Action": ["sagemaker:CreateEndpoint", "sagemaker:CreateEndpointConfig"]   "Resource": [   "arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint/endpointName"   "arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint-config/endpointConfigName"   ]  For more information, see SageMaker API Permissions: Actions, Permissions, and Resources Reference',

In the configuration, you identify one or more models, created using the CreateModel API, to deploy and the resources that you want SageMaker to provision. Then you call the CreateEndpoint API.   Use this API if you want to use SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into production.   In the request, you define a ProductionVariant, for each model that you want to deploy. Each ProductionVariant parameter also describes the resources that you want SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy.  If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a VariantWeight to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B.

In a CreateNotebookInstance request, specify the type of ML compute instance that you want to run. SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance.  SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework.  After receiving the request, SageMaker does the following:   Creates a network interface in the SageMaker VPC.   (Option) If you specified SubnetId, SageMaker creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.   Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the SageMaker VPC. If you specified SubnetId of your VPC, SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.   After creating the notebook instance, SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can't change the name of a notebook instance after you create it. After SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models.

Amazon SageMaker Training Plan is a capability within SageMaker that allows customers to reserve and manage GPU capacity for large-scale AI model training.

How it works  Plans can be created for specific resources such as SageMaker Training Jobs or SageMaker HyperPod clusters, automatically provisioning resources, setting up infrastructure, executing workloads, and handling infrastructure failures.  Plan creation workflow    Users search for available plan offerings based on their requirements (e.g., instance type, count, start time, duration) using the  SearchTrainingPlanOfferings  API operation.   They create a plan that best matches their needs using the ID of the plan offering they want to use.    After successful upfront payment, the plan's status becomes Scheduled.    The plan can be used to:   Queue training jobs.   Allocate to an instance group of a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.      When the plan start date arrives, it becomes Active. Based on available reserved capacity:   Training jobs are launched.   Instance groups are provisioned.      Plan composition  A plan can consist of one or more Reserved Capacities, each defined by a specific instance type, quantity, Availability Zone, duration, and start and end times.

Lambda Step  A pipeline execution can\'t be stopped while a lambda step is running because the Lambda function invoked by the lambda step can\'t be stopped. If you attempt to stop the execution while the Lambda function is running, the pipeline waits for the Lambda function to finish or until the timeout is hit, whichever occurs first, and then stops.
