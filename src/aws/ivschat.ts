    'Introduction  The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need to integrate with the  Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API, to enable users to interact with chat rooms in real time. The API is an AWS regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the Amazon IVS Chat information on the Amazon IVS page in the AWS General Reference.   Notes on terminology:    You create service applications using the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as applications.   You create front-end client applications (browser and Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to these as clients.     Key Concepts     LoggingConfiguration \u2014 A configuration that allows customers to store and record sent messages in a chat room.    Room \u2014 The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients connect to and exchange chat messages.    Tagging  A tag is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a key and a value, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as topic:nature to label a particular video category. See Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there. Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see Access Tags). The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints: TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource. The following resource supports tagging: Room. At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.  API Access Security  Your Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the differences between these concepts:    Authentication is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.    Authorization is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.   Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you create using the CreateChatToken endpoint through the AWS SDK. You call CreateChatToken for every user\u2019s chat session, passing identity and authorization information about the user.  Signing API Requests  HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4 signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP API directly, it\u2019s your responsibility to sign the requests. You generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage requests must be made using an IAM role that has the ivschat:DeleteMessage permission. For more information:   Authentication and generating signatures \u2014 See Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.   Managing Amazon IVS permissions \u2014 See Identity and Access Management on the Security page of the Amazon IVS User Guide.    Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies and API calls. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names in the AWS General Reference.  Messaging Endpoints     DeleteMessage \u2014 Sends an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client\u2019s chat history. This event\u2019s EventName is aws:DELETE_MESSAGE. This replicates the  DeleteMessage WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.    DisconnectUser \u2014 Disconnects all connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the  DisconnectUser WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.    SendEvent \u2014 Sends an event to a room. Use this within your application\u2019s business logic to send events to clients of a room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is rendered.    Chat Token Endpoint     CreateChatToken \u2014 Creates an encrypted token that is used by a chat participant to establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a room. When the token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid for the session duration specified in the request. The token becomes invalid at the token-expiration timestamp included in the response.    Room Endpoints     CreateRoom \u2014 Creates a room that allows clients to connect and pass messages.    DeleteRoom \u2014 Deletes the specified room.    GetRoom \u2014 Gets the specified room.    ListRooms \u2014 Gets summary information about all your rooms in the AWS region where the API request is processed.     UpdateRoom \u2014 Updates a room\u2019s configuration.    Logging Configuration Endpoints     CreateLoggingConfiguration \u2014 Creates a logging configuration that allows clients to store and record sent messages.    DeleteLoggingConfiguration \u2014 Deletes the specified logging configuration.    GetLoggingConfiguration \u2014 Gets the specified logging configuration.    ListLoggingConfigurations \u2014 Gets summary information about all your logging configurations in the AWS region where the API request is processed.    UpdateLoggingConfiguration \u2014 Updates a specified logging configuration.    Tags Endpoints     ListTagsForResource \u2014 Gets information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.    TagResource \u2014 Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the specified ARN.    UntagResource \u2014 Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.   All the above are HTTP operations. There is a separate messaging API for managing Chat resources; see the  Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API Reference',
