        "Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. For example, if the default timeout for a queue is 60 seconds, 15 seconds have elapsed since you received the message, and you send a ChangeMessageVisibility call with VisibilityTimeout set to 10 seconds, the 10 seconds begin to count from the time that you make the ChangeMessageVisibility call. Thus, any attempt to change the visibility timeout or to delete that message 10 seconds after you initially change the visibility timeout (a total of 25 seconds) might result in an error. An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:   Sent to a queue by a producer.   Received from the queue by a consumer.   Deleted from the queue.   A message is considered to be stored after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be in flight after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of in flight messages. Limits that apply to in flight messages are unrelated to the unlimited number of stored messages. For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the OverLimit error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, file a support request. For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.  If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time. Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the ChangeMessageVisibility action) the next time the message is received",

Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.     MaximumMessageSize \u2013 The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).     MessageRetentionPeriod \u2013 The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages.    Policy \u2013 The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide.     ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds \u2013 The length of time, in seconds, for which a  ReceiveMessage  action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.     VisibilityTimeout \u2013 The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.   The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:     RedrivePolicy \u2013 The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    deadLetterTargetArn \u2013 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.    maxReceiveCount \u2013 The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.      RedriveAllowPolicy \u2013 The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    redrivePermission \u2013 The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:    allowAll \u2013 (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    denyAll \u2013 No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    byQueue \u2013 Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.      sourceQueueArns \u2013 The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll.      The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.  The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId \u2013 The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. While the alias of the Amazon Web Services managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be alias/MyAlias . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.     KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds \u2013 The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?     SqsManagedSseEnabled \u2013 Enables server-side queue encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS).   The following attributes apply only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues:    FifoQueue \u2013 Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are true and false. If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only during queue creation. You can't change it for an existing queue. When you set this attribute, you must also provide the MessageGroupId for your messages explicitly. For more information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.    ContentBasedDeduplication \u2013 Enables content-based deduplication. Valid values are true and false. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. Note the following:    Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId.   You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.   If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).    If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the queue doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails with an error.   If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one.     When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.   If you send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is the same as the one generated for the first MessageDeduplicationId, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.      The following attributes apply only to high throughput for FIFO queues:    DeduplicationScope \u2013 Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue.    FifoThroughputLimit \u2013 Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId. The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup.   To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:   Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup.   Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId.   If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide",

Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue.   The ReceiptHandle is associated with a specific instance of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the ReceiptHandle is different each time you receive a message. When you use the DeleteMessage action, you must provide the most recently received ReceiptHandle for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message will not be deleted). For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues",

In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.  The following attributes are supported:  The ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed, ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible, and ApproximateNumberOfMessages metrics may not achieve consistency until at least 1 minute after the producers stop sending messages. This period is required for the queue metadata to reach eventual consistency.      All \u2013 Returns all values.     ApproximateNumberOfMessages \u2013 Returns the approximate number of messages available for retrieval from the queue.    ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed \u2013 Returns the approximate number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter.    ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible \u2013 Returns the approximate number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered to be in flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window.     CreatedTimestamp \u2013 Returns the time when the queue was created in seconds (epoch time).    DelaySeconds \u2013 Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds.    LastModifiedTimestamp \u2013 Returns the time when the queue was last changed in seconds (epoch time).    MaximumMessageSize \u2013 Returns the limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.    MessageRetentionPeriod \u2013 Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages.    Policy \u2013 Returns the policy of the queue.    QueueArn \u2013 Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue.    ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds \u2013 Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which the ReceiveMessage action waits for a message to arrive.     VisibilityTimeout \u2013 Returns the visibility timeout for the queue. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.    The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:     RedrivePolicy \u2013 The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    deadLetterTargetArn \u2013 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.    maxReceiveCount \u2013 The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.      RedriveAllowPolicy \u2013 The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    redrivePermission \u2013 The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:    allowAll \u2013 (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    denyAll \u2013 No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    byQueue \u2013 Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.      sourceQueueArns \u2013 The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll.      The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.  The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId \u2013 Returns the ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms.     KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds \u2013 Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?.     SqsManagedSseEnabled \u2013 Returns information about whether the queue is using SSE-SQS encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS).   The following attributes apply only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues:    FifoQueue \u2013 Returns information about whether the queue is FIFO. For more information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether QueueName ends with the .fifo suffix.     ContentBasedDeduplication \u2013 Returns whether content-based deduplication is enabled for the queue. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.    The following attributes apply only to high throughput for FIFO queues:    DeduplicationScope \u2013 Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue.    FifoThroughputLimit \u2013 Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId. The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup.   To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:   Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup.   Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId.   If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide",

For more information, see Amazon SQS Long Polling in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a ReceiveMessage call. Thus, only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per ReceiveMessage call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular ReceiveMessage response. If this happens, repeat the request.  For each message returned, the response includes the following:   The message body.   An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see RFC1321.   The MessageId you received when you sent the message to the queue.   The receipt handle.   The message attributes.   An MD5 digest of the message attributes.   The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see Queue and Message Identifiers in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. You can provide the VisibilityTimeout parameter in your request. The parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don't include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue.  In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully",

            "This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues. The token used for deduplication of ReceiveMessage calls. If a networking issue occurs after a ReceiveMessage action, and instead of a response you receive a generic error, it is possible to retry the same action with an identical ReceiveRequestAttemptId to retrieve the same set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet expired.   You can use ReceiveRequestAttemptId only for 5 minutes after a ReceiveMessage action.   When you set FifoQueue, a caller of the ReceiveMessage action can provide a ReceiveRequestAttemptId explicitly.   It is possible to retry the ReceiveMessage action with the same ReceiveRequestAttemptId if none of the messages have been modified (deleted or had their visibility changes).   During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same ReceiveRequestAttemptId return the same messages and receipt handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  If a caller of the ReceiveMessage action still processes messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error. To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary.    While messages with a particular MessageGroupId are invisible, no more messages belonging to the same MessageGroupId are returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages with another MessageGroupId as long as it is also visible.   If a caller of ReceiveMessage can't track the ReceiveRequestAttemptId, no retries work until the original visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in the queue remain in a strict order.   The maximum length of ReceiveRequestAttemptId is 128 characters. ReceiveRequestAttemptId can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~).

For more information, see  Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.   Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId,   You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.   If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).    If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the queue doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails with an error.   If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one.     When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.   If you send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is the same as the one generated for the first MessageDeduplicationId, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.     The MessageDeduplicationId is available to the consumer of the message (this can be useful for troubleshooting delivery issues). If a message is sent successfully but the acknowledgement is lost and the message is resent with the same MessageDeduplicationId after the deduplication interval, Amazon SQS can't detect duplicate messages. Amazon SQS continues to keep track of the message deduplication ID even after the message is received and deleted.  The maximum length of MessageDeduplicationId is 128 characters. MessageDeduplicationId can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~).

Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.     MaximumMessageSize \u2013 The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).     MessageRetentionPeriod \u2013 The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages.    Policy \u2013 The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies in the Identity and Access Management User Guide.     ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds \u2013 The length of time, in seconds, for which a  ReceiveMessage  action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.     VisibilityTimeout \u2013 The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.   The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:     RedrivePolicy \u2013 The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    deadLetterTargetArn \u2013 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.    maxReceiveCount \u2013 The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.      RedriveAllowPolicy \u2013 The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    redrivePermission \u2013 The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:    allowAll \u2013 (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    denyAll \u2013 No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    byQueue \u2013 Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.      sourceQueueArns \u2013 The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll.      The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.  The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId \u2013 The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be alias/MyAlias . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.     KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds \u2013 The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?.     SqsManagedSseEnabled \u2013 Enables server-side queue encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS).   The following attribute applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues:    ContentBasedDeduplication \u2013 Enables content-based deduplication. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. Note the following:    Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId.   You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.   If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).    If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the queue doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails with an error.   If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one.     When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.   If you send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is the same as the one generated for the first MessageDeduplicationId, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.      The following attributes apply only to high throughput for FIFO queues:    DeduplicationScope \u2013 Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue.    FifoThroughputLimit \u2013 Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId. The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup.   To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:   Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup.   Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId.   If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide",
