    "AWS Key Management Service AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used API Operations  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. Also, the  kmsuser crypto user (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this account to log in. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the kmsuser CU, and rotates its password. The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ConnectCustomKeyStore again.

Symmetric CMKs contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can use a symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair.    Asymmetric CMKs can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages.   For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance:  Asymmetric CMKs  To create an asymmetric CMK, use the CustomerMasterKeySpec parameter to specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the KeyUsage parameter to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the CMK is created.    Symmetric CMKs  When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't need to specify the CustomerMasterKeySpec or KeyUsage parameters. The default value for CustomerMasterKeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default value for KeyUsage, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs.     Imported Key Material  To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL. Next, use GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see Importing Key Material in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . You cannot import the key material into an asymmetric CMK.    Custom Key Stores  To create a symmetric CMK in a custom key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to specify the custom key store. You must also use the Origin parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the AWS Region.  You cannot create an asymmetric CMK in a custom key store. For information about custom key stores in AWS KMS see Using Custom Key Stores in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .    Cross-account use: No. You cannot use this operation to create a CMK in a different AWS account.  Required permissions: kms:CreateKey (IAM policy). To use the Tags parameter, kms:TagResource (IAM policy). For examples and information about related permissions, see Allow a user to create CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

When the CMK is asymmetric, you must specify the CMK and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the KeyId parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the CMK is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the KeyId parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS only uses the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the Decrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend. Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for Decrypt permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts. For details, see Best practices for IAM policies in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes.

This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store. By default, this operation returns information about all custom key stores in the account and region. To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the CustomKeyStoreName or CustomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both). To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, use the ConnectionState element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the ConnectionState value is FAILED and the ConnectionErrorCode element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. Custom key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state if the key store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any.

        "Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The Encrypt operation has two primary use cases:   You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a personal identifier or database password, or other sensitive information.    You can use the Encrypt operation to move encrypted data from one AWS Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key and use the plaintext key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the Encrypt operation to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region B. Now, you can move the encrypted data and the encrypted data key to Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted data key and the encrypted data entirely within in Region B.   You don't need to use the Encrypt operation to encrypt a data key. The GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair operations return a plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key. When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in the encryption operation. The CMK must have a KeyUsage value of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. To find the KeyUsage of a CMK, use the DescribeKey operation.  If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.

To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the GenerateDataKeyPair or GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operations.  GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext is identical to the GenerateDataKey operation except that returns only the encrypted copy of the data key. This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the Decrypt operation on the encrypted copy of the key.  It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key.  GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext returns a unique data key for each request. The bytes in the keys are not related to the caller or CMK that is used to encrypt the private key. To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric customer master key (CMK) that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK to generate a data key. To get the type of your CMK, use the DescribeKey operation. If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the CiphertextBlob field. You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

Unlike the private key of a asymmetric CMK, which never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted, callers with kms:GetPublicKey permission can download the public key of an asymmetric CMK. You can share the public key to allow others to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within AWS KMS by calling the Encrypt, ReEncrypt, or Verify operations with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK. When you use the public key within AWS KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For details, see Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys. To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, GetPublicKey returns important information about the public key in the response, including:    CustomerMasterKeySpec: The type of key material in the public key, such as RSA_4096 or ECC_NIST_P521.    KeyUsage: Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.    EncryptionAlgorithms or SigningAlgorithms: A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.

        'Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within AWS KMS. You can use this operation to change the customer master key (CMK) under which data is encrypted, such as when you manually rotate a CMK or change the CMK that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext. The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as Encrypt or GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS. When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must use the SourceKeyId parameter to identify the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the SourceKeyId parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they\'ve lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the source CMK is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the SourceKeyId parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS uses only the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the ReEncrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.   To reencrypt the data, you must use the DestinationKeyId parameter specify the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes. The source CMK and destination CMK can be in different AWS accounts. Either or both CMKs can be in a different account than the caller.  Required permissions:    kms:ReEncryptFrom permission on the source CMK (key policy)    kms:ReEncryptTo permission on the destination CMK (key policy)   To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the "kms:ReEncrypt*" permission in your key policy. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK programmatically or when you use the PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy.

If you do not provide a waiting period, the default period of 30 days is used. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to PendingDeletion. Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.  Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use DisableKey.  If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a custom key store, when the waiting period expires, ScheduleKeyDeletion deletes the CMK from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.

To verify the signature, use the Verify operation, or use the public key in the same asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer master key (CMK). The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed.  To use the Sign operation, provide the following information:   Use the KeyId parameter to identify an asymmetric CMK with a KeyUsage value of SIGN_VERIFY. To get the KeyUsage value of a CMK, use the DescribeKey operation. The caller must have kms:Sign permission on the CMK.   Use the Message parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest in the Message parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the MessageType parameter.   Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the CMK.     When signing a message, be sure to record the CMK and the signing algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.  To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the Verify operation. Or use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS.

Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the specified CMK and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the SignatureValid field in the response is True. If the signature verification fails, the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSignatureException exception. A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric CMK. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To verify a digital signature, you can use the Verify operation. Specify the same asymmetric CMK, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the signature. You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside of AWS KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS. The advantage of using the Verify operation is that it is performed within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the CMK to verify signatures. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
