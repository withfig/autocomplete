    "Key Management Service Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS, see the  Key Management Service Developer Guide .  KMS has replaced the term customer master key (CMK) with KMS key and KMS key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term. Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS. If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see Service endpoints in the Key Management Service topic of the Amazon Web Services General Reference. All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests.  All KMS requests must be signed with Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    Amazon Web Services Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used API Operations  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

For an external key store, ConnectCustomKeyStore connects the key store to the external key store proxy that communicates with your external key manager. The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. The connection process for a custom key store can take an extended amount of time to complete. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.  This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage. The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ConnectCustomKeyStore again.  CloudHSM key store  During the connection process for an CloudHSM key store, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the CloudHSM client as the kmsuser CU, and rotates its password. To connect an CloudHSM key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. Also, the  kmsuser crypto user (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents KMS from using this account to log in. If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a CloudHSM key store, see Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key store in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.  External key store  When you connect an external key store that uses public endpoint connectivity, KMS tests its ability to communicate with your external key manager by sending a request via the external key store proxy. When you connect to an external key store that uses VPC endpoint service connectivity, KMS establishes the networking elements that it needs to communicate with your external key manager via the external key store proxy. This includes creating an interface endpoint to the VPC endpoint service and a private hosted zone for traffic between KMS and the VPC endpoint service. To connect an external key store, KMS must be able to connect to the external key store proxy, the external key store proxy must be able to communicate with your external key manager, and the external key manager must be available for cryptographic operations. If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting an external key store, see Troubleshooting an external key store in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

When you use a KMS key in a custom key store for a cryptographic operation, the cryptographic operation is actually performed in your key store using your keys. KMS supports CloudHSM key stores backed by an CloudHSM cluster and external key stores backed by an external key store proxy and external key manager outside of Amazon Web Services.  This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage. Before you create the custom key store, the required elements must be in place and operational. We recommend that you use the test tools that KMS provides to verify the configuration your external key store proxy. For details about the required elements and verification tests, see Assemble the prerequisites (for CloudHSM key stores) or Assemble the prerequisites (for external key stores) in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. To create a custom key store, use the following parameters.   To create an CloudHSM key store, specify the CustomKeyStoreName, CloudHsmClusterId, KeyStorePassword, and TrustAnchorCertificate. The CustomKeyStoreType parameter is optional for CloudHSM key stores. If you include it, set it to the default value, AWS_CLOUDHSM. For help with failures, see Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key store in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.   To create an external key store, specify the CustomKeyStoreName and a CustomKeyStoreType of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE. Also, specify values for XksProxyConnectivity, XksProxyAuthenticationCredential, XksProxyUriEndpoint, and XksProxyUriPath. If your XksProxyConnectivity value is VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE, specify the XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName parameter. For help with failures, see Troubleshooting an external key store in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.    For external key stores: Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation. When creating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You cannot use a proxy configuration with the CreateCustomKeyStore operation. However, you can use the values in the file to help you determine the correct values for the CreateCustomKeyStore parameters.  When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect a new CloudHSM key store to its CloudHSM cluster, or to connect a new external key store to the external key store proxy for your external key manager. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.

        "Adds a grant to a KMS key.  A grant is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a KMS key (DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.  For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in KMS in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see Programming grants.  The CreateGrant operation returns a GrantToken and a GrantId.   When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available throughout KMS. This state is known as eventual consistency. Once the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant.  However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the GrantToken that CreateGrant returns. For details, see Using a grant token in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide .   The CreateGrant operation also returns a GrantId. You can use the GrantId and a key identifier to identify the grant in the RetireGrant and RevokeGrant operations. To find the grant ID, use the ListGrants or ListRetirableGrants operations.   The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

      description:
        "Creates a unique customer managed KMS key in your Amazon Web Services account and Region. You can use a KMS key in cryptographic operations, such as encryption and signing. Some Amazon Web Services services let you use KMS keys that you create and manage to protect your service resources. A KMS key is a logical representation of a cryptographic key. In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, a KMS key includes metadata, such as the key ID, key policy, creation date, description, and key state. For details, see Managing keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide  Use the parameters of CreateKey to specify the type of KMS key, the source of its key material, its key policy, description, tags, and other properties.  KMS has replaced the term customer master key (CMK) with KMS key and KMS key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.  To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:  Symmetric encryption KMS key  By default, CreateKey creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with key material that KMS generates. This is the basic and most widely used type of KMS key, and provides the best performance. To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, you don't need to specify any parameters. The default value for KeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, the default value for KeyUsage, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, and the default value for Origin, AWS_KMS, create a symmetric encryption KMS key with KMS key material. If you need a key for basic encryption and decryption or you are creating a KMS key to protect your resources in an Amazon Web Services service, create a symmetric encryption KMS key. The key material in a symmetric encryption key never leaves KMS unencrypted. You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt and decrypt data up to 4,096 bytes, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair.    Asymmetric KMS keys  To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the KeySpec parameter to specify the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the KeyUsage parameter to determine whether the KMS key will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created. Asymmetric KMS keys contain an RSA key pair, Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair, or an SM2 key pair (China Regions only). The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of KMS. KMS keys with RSA or SM2 key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). KMS keys with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.    HMAC KMS key  To create an HMAC KMS key, set the KeySpec parameter to a key spec value for HMAC KMS keys. Then set the KeyUsage parameter to GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC. You must set the key usage even though GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC is the only valid key usage value for HMAC KMS keys. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created. HMAC KMS keys are symmetric keys that never leave KMS unencrypted. You can use HMAC keys to generate (GenerateMac) and verify (VerifyMac) HMAC codes for messages up to 4096 bytes.    Multi-Region primary keys Imported key material  To create a multi-Region primary key in the local Amazon Web Services Region, use the MultiRegion parameter with a value of True. To create a multi-Region replica key, that is, a KMS key with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a different Amazon Web Services Region, use the ReplicateKey operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation. You can create multi-Region KMS keys for all supported KMS key types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you can't create multi-Region keys in a custom key store. This operation supports multi-Region keys, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.     To import your own key material into a KMS key, begin by creating a KMS key with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL. Next, use GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token. Use the wrapping public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see Importing Key Material in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide . You can import key material into KMS keys of all supported KMS key types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you can't import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store. To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL and the MultiRegion parameter with a value of True. To create replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the ReplicateKey operation. For instructions, see Importing key material into multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.    Custom key store  A custom key store lets you protect your Amazon Web Services resources using keys in a backing key store that you own and manage. When you request a cryptographic operation with a KMS key in a custom key store, the operation is performed in the backing key store using its cryptographic keys. KMS supports CloudHSM key stores backed by an CloudHSM cluster and external key stores backed by an external key manager outside of Amazon Web Services. When you create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store, KMS generates an encryption key in the CloudHSM cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an external key store, you specify an existing encryption key in the external key manager.  Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.  Before you create a KMS key in a custom key store, the ConnectionState of the key store must be CONNECTED. To connect the custom key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation. To find the ConnectionState, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. To create a KMS key in a custom key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId. Use the default KeySpec value, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default KeyUsage value, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT to create a symmetric encryption key. No other key type is supported in a custom key store. To create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store, use the Origin parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM. The CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. To create a KMS key in an external key store, use the Origin parameter with a value of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE and an XksKeyId parameter that identifies an existing external key.  Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.     Cross-account use: No. You cannot use this operation to create a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.  Required permissions: kms:CreateKey (IAM policy). To use the Tags parameter, kms:TagResource (IAM policy). For examples and information about related permissions, see Allow a user to create KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

To use this parameter, you must have kms:TagResource permission in an IAM policy. Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one. When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For details, see Tagging Keys",

When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify the KMS key and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of KMS by the public key in an KMS asymmetric KMS key. However, it cannot decrypt symmetric ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the KeyId parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the KeyId parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the Decrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend. Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using &IAM; policies. Otherwise, you might create an &IAM; policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for Decrypt permissions, limit the user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts. For details, see Best practices for IAM policies in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Decrypt also supports Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, which provide an isolated compute environment in Amazon EC2. To call Decrypt for a Nitro enclave, use the Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves SDK or any Amazon Web Services SDK. Use the Recipient parameter to provide the attestation document for the enclave. Instead of the plaintext data, the response includes the plaintext data encrypted with the public key from the attestation document (CiphertextForRecipient). For information about the interaction between KMS and Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, see How Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves uses KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

You don't need to use the Encrypt operation to encrypt a data key. The GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair operations return a plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key. If you use a symmetric encryption KMS key, you can use an encryption context to add additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

You can use the plaintext key to encrypt your data outside of KMS and store the encrypted data key with the encrypted data. To generate a data key, specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that will be used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt data keys.

You can write your own code or use a client-side encryption library, such as the Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK, the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client, or Amazon S3 client-side encryption to do these tasks for you. To encrypt data outside of KMS:   Use the GenerateDataKey operation to get a data key.   Use the plaintext data key (in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt your data outside of KMS. Then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   Store the encrypted data key (in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) with the encrypted data.   To decrypt data outside of KMS:   Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.

This operation returns a plaintext public key, a plaintext private key, and a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric encryption KMS key you specify. You can use the data key pair to perform asymmetric cryptography and implement digital signatures outside of KMS. The bytes in the keys are random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key.  You can use the public key that GenerateDataKeyPair returns to encrypt data or verify a signature outside of KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted private key. To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.  Use the KeyPairSpec parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data key pair. In China Regions, you can also choose an SM2 data key pair. KMS recommends that you use ECC key pairs for signing, and use RSA and SM2 key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both. However, KMS cannot enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of KMS. If you are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any operation where you don't immediately need a private key, consider using the GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation. GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns a plaintext public key and an encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that you need only to decrypt ciphertext or sign a message. Later, when you need to decrypt the data or sign a message, use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted private key in the data key pair.  GenerateDataKeyPair returns a unique data key pair for each request. The bytes in the keys are random; they are not related to the caller or the KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key. The public key is a DER-encoded X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as specified in RFC 5280. The private key is a DER-encoded PKCS8 PrivateKeyInfo, as specified in RFC 5958.  GenerateDataKeyPair also supports Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, which provide an isolated compute environment in Amazon EC2.

Unlike GenerateDataKeyPair, this operation does not return a plaintext private key. The bytes in the keys are random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key.  You can use the public key that GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns to encrypt data or verify a signature outside of KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted private key. To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.  Use the KeyPairSpec parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data key pair.

However, KMS cannot enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of KMS.  GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext returns a unique data key pair for each request. The bytes in the key are not related to the caller or KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key. The public key is a DER-encoded X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as specified in RFC 5280.

The bytes in the key are random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key.  GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext is identical to the GenerateDataKey operation except that it does not return a plaintext copy of the data key.  This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the Decrypt operation on the encrypted copy of the key. It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key. To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the GenerateDataKeyPair or GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operations. To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a key in a custom key store to generate a data key. To get the type of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation. You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes parameters (but not both). For 128-bit and 256-bit data keys, use the KeySpec parameter. To generate an SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a KeySpec value of AES_128 or NumberOfBytes value of 16. The symmetric encryption key used in China Regions to encrypt your data key is an SM4 encryption key. If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the CiphertextBlob field. You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

Unlike the private key of a asymmetric KMS key, which never leaves KMS unencrypted, callers with kms:GetPublicKey permission can download the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of KMS. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within KMS by calling the Encrypt, ReEncrypt, or Verify operations with the identifier of an asymmetric KMS key. When you use the public key within KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of KMS. To help you use the public key safely outside of KMS, GetPublicKey returns important information about the public key in the response, including:    KeySpec: The type of key material in the public key, such as RSA_4096 or ECC_NIST_P521.    KeyUsage: Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.    EncryptionAlgorithms or SigningAlgorithms: A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.   Although KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation. To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS uses 1234567812345678 as the distinguishing ID.

If you set an expiration date, KMS deletes the key material from the KMS key on the specified date, making the KMS key unusable. To use the KMS key in cryptographic operations again, you must reimport the same key material. However, you can delete and reimport the key material at any time, including before the key material expires. Each time you reimport, you can eliminate or reset the expiration time.   When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes from PendingImport to Enabled, and you can use the KMS key in cryptographic operations. If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the problem. If the error is related to the key material, the import token, or wrapping key, use GetParametersForImport to get a new public key and import token for the KMS key and repeat the import procedure. For help, see How To Import Key Material in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

        'Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within KMS. You can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is encrypted, such as when you manually rotate a KMS key or change the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext. The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using a KMS key in an KMS operation, such as Encrypt or GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS. When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you must use the SourceKeyId parameter to identify the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the SourceKeyId parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they\'ve lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the SourceKeyId parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the ReEncrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.   To reencrypt the data, you must use the DestinationKeyId parameter to specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key.  When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric encryption KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.    The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a different account than the caller. To specify a KMS key in a different account, you must use its key ARN or alias ARN.  Required permissions:    kms:ReEncryptFrom permission on the source KMS key (key policy)    kms:ReEncryptTo permission on the destination KMS key (key policy)   To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the "kms:ReEncrypt*" permission in your key policy. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a KMS key. But you must include it manually when you create a KMS key programmatically or when you use the PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy.

        "Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the CreateKey operation. This operation supports multi-Region keys, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. A replica key is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same key ID and key material. They also have the same key spec, key usage, key material origin, and automatic key rotation status. KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its key policy, tags, aliases, and Key states of KMS keys. KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key. When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of Creating. This key state changes to Enabled (or PendingImport) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is Creating, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on KMSInvalidStateException or call DescribeKey to check its KeyState value before using it. For details about the Creating key state, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any Region. If the Region already includes a replica of the key you're trying to replicate, ReplicateKey returns an AlreadyExistsException error. If the key state of the existing replica is PendingDeletion, you can cancel the scheduled key deletion (CancelKeyDeletion) or wait for the key to be deleted. The new replica key you create will have the same shared properties as the original replica key. The CloudTrail log of a ReplicateKey operation records a ReplicateKey operation in the primary key's Region and a CreateKey operation in the replica key's Region. If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see Importing key material into multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.   ReplicateKey uses different default values for the KeyPolicy and Tags parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions.

When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes to PendingDeletion and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.  Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region replica key, or an asymmetric or HMAC KMS key with imported key material.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use DisableKey.   You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to PendingReplicaDeletion and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to PendingDeletion and its waiting period (PendingWindowInDays) begins. For details, see Deleting multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. When KMS deletes a KMS key from an CloudHSM key store, it makes a best effort to delete the associated key material from the associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. Deleting a KMS key from an external key store has no effect on the associated external key. However, for both types of custom key stores, deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible. You cannot decrypt ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only its associated external key or CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a KMS key in an external key store by creating a new KMS key with the same key material.

To verify the signature, use the Verify operation, or use the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric KMS key. The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed.  To use the Sign operation, provide the following information:   Use the KeyId parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a KeyUsage value of SIGN_VERIFY. To get the KeyUsage value of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation. The caller must have kms:Sign permission on the KMS key.   Use the Message parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest in the Message parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the MessageType parameter.   Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the KMS key.     When signing a message, be sure to record the KMS key and the signing algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.   Best practices recommend that you limit the time during which any signature is effective. This deters an attack where the actor uses a signed message to establish validity repeatedly or long after the message is superseded. Signatures do not include a timestamp, but you can include a timestamp in the signed message to help you detect when its time to refresh the signature.   To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the Verify operation. Or use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of KMS.  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes.

Use the DIGEST value only when the value of the Message parameter is a message digest. If you use the DIGEST value with an unhashed message, the security of the signing operation can be compromised.  When the value of MessageTypeis DIGEST, the length of the Message value must match the length of hashed messages for the specified signing algorithm.

Use the required CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the custom key store. Use the remaining optional parameters to change its properties. This operation does not return any property values. To verify the updated property values, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.  This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.  When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the updated settings connect your key store, via the external key store proxy, to the same external key manager as the previous settings, or to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with the same cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can fix them and retry, although an extended delay might disrupt Amazon Web Services services. However, if KMS permanently loses its access to cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys is unrecoverable.   For external key stores: Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation. When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You cannot upload the proxy configuration file to the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation. However, you can use the file to help you determine the correct values for the UpdateCustomKeyStore parameters.  For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (NewCustomKeyStoreName), to tell KMS about a change to the kmsuser crypto user password (KeyStorePassword), or to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, CloudHSM cluster (CloudHsmClusterId). To update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the ConnectionState of the CloudHSM key store must be DISCONNECTED.  For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (NewCustomKeyStoreName), or to tell KMS about a change to the external key store proxy authentication credentials (XksProxyAuthenticationCredential), connection method (XksProxyConnectivity), external proxy endpoint (XksProxyUriEndpoint) and path (XksProxyUriPath). For external key stores with an XksProxyConnectivity of VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE, you can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name (XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName). To update most properties of an external key store, the ConnectionState of the external key store must be DISCONNECTED. However, you can update the CustomKeyStoreName, XksProxyAuthenticationCredential, and XksProxyUriPath of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED state.  If your update requires a DISCONNECTED state, before using UpdateCustomKeyStore, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store. After the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation completes, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore to reconnect the custom key store. To find the ConnectionState of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.    Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store. For example, before you change the XksProxyUriPath value, verify that the external key store proxy is reachable at the new path. If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.  Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

        "Changes the primary key of a multi-Region key.  This operation changes the replica key in the specified Region to a primary key and changes the former primary key to a replica key. For example, suppose you have a primary key in us-east-1 and a replica key in eu-west-2. If you run UpdatePrimaryRegion with a PrimaryRegion value of eu-west-2, the primary key is now the key in eu-west-2, and the key in us-east-1 becomes a replica key. For details, see Updating the primary Region in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. This operation supports multi-Region keys, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Multi-Region keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. The primary key of a multi-Region key is the source for properties that are always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key material, key ID, key spec, key usage, key material origin, and automatic key rotation. It's the only key that can be replicated. You cannot delete the primary key until all replica keys are deleted. The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the replica key that will become the primary key. The primary Region must already have a replica key. This operation does not create a KMS key in the specified Region. To find the replica keys, use the DescribeKey operation on the primary key or any replica key. To create a replica key, use the ReplicateKey operation. You can run this operation while using the affected multi-Region keys in cryptographic operations. This operation should not delay, interrupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations.  Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the primary Region might still be in progress for a few more seconds. Operations such as DescribeKey might display both the old and new primary keys as replicas. The old and new primary keys have a transient key state of Updating. The original key state is restored when the update is complete. While the key state is Updating, you can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate the new primary key or perform certain management operations, such as enabling or disabling these keys. For details about the Updating key state, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. This operation does not return any output. To verify that primary key is changed, use the DescribeKey operation.  Cross-account use: No. You cannot use this operation in a different Amazon Web Services account.

Include this permission primary key's key policy.    kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion on the current replica key (in the replica key's Region). Include this permission in the replica key's key policy.

        "Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the Sign operation.   Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the specified KMS key and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the SignatureValid field in the response is True. If the signature verification fails, the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSignatureException exception. A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric KMS key. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. To use the Verify operation, specify the same asymmetric KMS key, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the signature. The message type does not need to be the same as the one used for signing, but it must indicate whether the value of the Message parameter should be hashed as part of the verification process. You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the KMS key outside of KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric KMS key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of KMS. The advantage of using the Verify operation is that it is performed within KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify signatures. To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS uses 1234567812345678 as the distinguishing ID. For more information, see Offline verification with SM2 key pairs. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes.

When the value of MessageType is RAW, KMS uses the standard signing algorithm, which begins with a hash function. When the value is DIGEST, KMS skips the hashing step in the signing algorithm.  Use the DIGEST value only when the value of the Message parameter is a message digest. If you use the DIGEST value with an unhashed message, the security of the verification operation can be compromised.  When the value of MessageTypeis DIGEST, the length of the Message value must match the length of hashed messages for the specified signing algorithm. You can submit a message digest and omit the MessageType or specify RAW so the digest is hashed again while signing. However, if the signed message is hashed once while signing, but twice while verifying, verification fails, even when the message hasn't changed. The hashing algorithm in that Verify uses is based on the SigningAlgorithm value.   Signing algorithms that end in SHA_256 use the SHA_256 hashing algorithm.   Signing algorithms that end in SHA_384 use the SHA_384 hashing algorithm.   Signing algorithms that end in SHA_512 use the SHA_512 hashing algorithm.   SM2DSA uses the SM3 hashing algorithm.
