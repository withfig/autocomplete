If you want to enforce multiple policy types across accounts, you can create multiple policies. You can create more than one policy for each type.  If you add a new account to an organization that you created with Organizations, Firewall Manager automatically applies the policy to the resources in that account that are within scope of the policy.  Firewall Manager provides the following types of policies:     WAF policy - This policy applies WAF web ACL protections to specified accounts and resources.     Shield Advanced policy - This policy applies Shield Advanced protection to specified accounts and resources.     Security Groups policy - This type of policy gives you control over security groups that are in use throughout your organization in Organizations and lets you enforce a baseline set of rules across your organization.     Network ACL policy - This type of policy gives you control over the network ACLs that are in use throughout your organization in Organizations and lets you enforce a baseline set of first and last network ACL rules across your organization.     Network Firewall policy - This policy applies Network Firewall protection to your organization's VPCs.     DNS Firewall policy - This policy applies Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall protections to your organization's VPCs.     Third-party firewall policy - This policy applies third-party firewall protections. Third-party firewalls are available by subscription through the Amazon Web Services Marketplace console at Amazon Web Services Marketplace.    Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW policy - This policy applies Palo Alto Networks Cloud Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) protections and Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW rulestacks to your organization's VPCs.    Fortigate CNF policy - This policy applies Fortigate Cloud Native Firewall (CNF) protections.
