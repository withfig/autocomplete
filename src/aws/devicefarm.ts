Allowed values include:   ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example).   PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS.   OS_VERSION: The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2).   MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen).   AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.   FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET.   MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer (for example, Apple).   REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE.   REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Because remote debugging is no longer supported, this attribute is ignored.   INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance.   INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance.   FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE.     Operator: The filter operator.   The EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except INSTANCE_LABELS.   The CONTAINS operator is available for the INSTANCE_LABELS and MODEL attributes.   The IN and NOT_IN operators are available for the ARN, OS_VERSION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes.   The LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, and GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators are also available for the OS_VERSION attribute.     Values: An array of one or more filter values.   The IN and NOT_IN operators take a values array that has one or more elements.   The other operators require an array with a single element.
