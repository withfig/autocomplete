    "CloudFormation CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web Services infrastructure. With CloudFormation, you declare all your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you. For more information about CloudFormation, see the CloudFormation product page. CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products.

To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.  Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them.

For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources. To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED.

CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.  This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability.

CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using CloudFormation macros to perform custom processing on templates.    Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified",

To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You can't specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)   To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but don't include the parameter in the list.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify this property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template",

For those stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

Stack sets with service-managed permissions don't currently support the use of macros in templates.

Use ListStackInstances to return a list of stack instances belonging to the stack set, including the drift status and last drift time checked of each instance.   Use DescribeStackInstance to return detailed information about a specific stack instance, including its drift status and last drift time checked.

CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.

The command returns a copy of your template, replacing references to\nlocal artifacts with the S3 location where the command uploaded the artifacts.\n\nUse this command to quickly upload local artifacts that might be required by\nyour template. After you package your template's artifacts, run the ``deploy``\ncommand to deploy the returned template.\n\nThis command can upload local artifacts referenced in the following places:\n\n\n    - ``BodyS3Location`` property for the ``AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi`` resource\n    - ``Code`` property for the ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resource\n    - ``Content`` property for the ``AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion`` resource\n    - ``CodeUri`` property for the ``AWS::Serverless::Function`` resource\n    - ``ContentUri`` property for the ``AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion`` resource\n    - ``Location`` property for the ``AWS::Serverless::Application`` resource\n    - ``DefinitionS3Location`` property for the ``AWS::AppSync::GraphQLSchema`` resource\n    - ``RequestMappingTemplateS3Location`` property for the ``AWS::AppSync::Resolver`` resource\n    - ``ResponseMappingTemplateS3Location`` property for the ``AWS::AppSync::Resolver`` resource\n    - ``RequestMappingTemplateS3Location`` property for the ``AWS::AppSync::FunctionConfiguration`` resource\n    - ``ResponseMappingTemplateS3Location`` property for the ``AWS::AppSync::FunctionConfiguration`` resource\n    - ``DefinitionUri`` property for the ``AWS::Serverless::Api`` resource\n    - ``Location`` parameter for the ``AWS::Include`` transform\n    - ``SourceBundle`` property for the ``AWS::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplicationVersion`` resource\n    - ``TemplateURL`` property for the ``AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`` resource\n    - ``Command.ScriptLocation`` property for the ``AWS::Glue::Job`` resource\n    - ``DefinitionS3Location`` property for the ``AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`` resource\n    - ``DefinitionUri`` property for the ``AWS::Serverless::StateMachine`` resource\n    - ``S3`` property for the ``AWS::CodeCommit::Repository`` resource\n\n\nTo specify a local artifact in your template, specify a path to a local file or folder,\nas either an absolute or relative path. The relative path is a location\nthat is relative to your template's location.\n\nFor example, if your AWS Lambda function source code is in the\n``/home/user/code/lambdafunction/`` folder, specify\n``CodeUri: /home/user/code/lambdafunction`` for the\n``AWS::Serverless::Function`` resource. The command returns a template and replaces\nthe local path with the S3 location: ``CodeUri: s3://mybucket/lambdafunction.zip``.\n\nIf you specify a file, the command directly uploads it to the S3 bucket. If you\nspecify a folder, the command zips the folder and then uploads the .zip file.\nFor most resources, if you don't specify a path, the command zips and uploads the\ncurrent working directory. The exception is ``AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi``;\nif you don't specify a ``BodyS3Location``, this command will not upload an artifact to S3.\n\nBefore the command uploads artifacts, it checks if the artifacts are already\npresent in the S3 bucket to prevent unnecessary uploads. The command uses MD5\nchecksums to compare files. If the values match, the command doesn't upload the\nartifacts. Use the ``--force-upload flag`` to skip this check and always upload the\nartifacts",
