    "Welcome to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC). You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone. You can also configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource. Zonal autoshift is a capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon Web Services shifts away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone, on your behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery during events. Amazon Web Services shifts away traffic for resources that are enabled for zonal autoshift whenever Amazon Web Services determines that there's an issue in the Availability Zone that could potentially affect customers. To ensure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you must also configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a resource. Practice runs start weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to shift traffic for the resource out of an Availability Zone. Practice runs make sure, on a regular basis, that you have enough capacity in all the Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region for your application to continue to operate normally when traffic for a resource is shifted away from one Availability Zone.  You must prescale resource capacity in all Availability Zones in the Region where your application is deployed, before you configure practice runs or enable zonal autoshift for a resource. You should not rely on scaling on demand when an autoshift or practice run starts.   For more information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide",

You can start a zonal shift in Route 53 ARC only for managed resources in your Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web Services Region. Resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC by Amazon Web Services services. At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off. When you start a zonal shift, traffic for the resource is no longer routed to the Availability Zone. The zonal shift is created immediately in Route 53 ARC. However, it can take a short time, typically up to a few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in the Availability Zone to complete.
