    "This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect potential defects that are difficult for developers to find and recommendations to address them in your Java and Python code. By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing code defects and implementing best practices, CodeGuru Reviewer improves the overall quality and maintainability of your code base during the code review stage. For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the  Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.   To improve the security of your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by creating an interface VPC endpoint. For more information, see CodeGuru Reviewer and interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide",

When you associate a repository, CodeGuru Reviewer reviews source code changes in the repository's pull requests and provides automatic recommendations. You can view recommendations using the CodeGuru Reviewer console. For more information, see Recommendations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.  If you associate a CodeCommit repository, it must be in the same AWS Region and AWS account where its CodeGuru Reviewer code reviews are configured. Bitbucket and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories are managed by AWS CodeStar Connections to connect to CodeGuru Reviewer. For more information, see Associate a repository in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.    You cannot use the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK or the AWS CLI to associate a GitHub repository with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. To associate a GitHub repository, use the console.
