The Amazon QuickSight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the Resolved flag included.  To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved.     Amazon Web Services account - The Amazon Web Services account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services Services. When you subscribe to Amazon QuickSight, you choose one Amazon Web Services Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use Amazon QuickSight in any supported Amazon Web Services Region.     Amazon Web Services Region - In each Amazon Web Services Region where you sign in to Amazon QuickSight at least once, Amazon QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to Amazon QuickSight in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace.  To run the command in a different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the CLI, you can use one of the following options:   Use command line options.    Use named profiles.    Run aws configure to change your default Amazon Web Services Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information, see Configuring the CLI.      Namespace - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.    Applied customizations - Within an Amazon Web Services Region, a set of Amazon QuickSight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account. All settings are isolated to a single Amazon Web Services Region. To apply them in other Amazon Web Services Regions, run the CreateAccountCustomization command in each Amazon Web Services Region where you want to apply the same customizations",

        "Starts an asynchronous job that generates a snapshot of a dashboard's output. You can request one or several of the following format configurations in each API call.   1 Paginated PDF   1 Excel workbook that includes up to 5 table or pivot table visuals   5 CSVs from table or pivot table visuals   The status of a submitted job can be polled with the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob API. When you call the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob API, check the JobStatus field in the response. Once the job reaches a COMPLETED or FAILED status, use the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult API to obtain the URLs for the generated files. If the job fails, the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult API returns detailed information about the error that occurred.  StartDashboardSnapshotJob API throttling  Amazon QuickSight utilizes API throttling to create a more consistent user experience within a time span for customers when they call the StartDashboardSnapshotJob. By default, 12 jobs can run simlutaneously in one Amazon Web Services account and users can submit up 10 API requests per second before an account is throttled. If an overwhelming number of API requests are made by the same user in a short period of time, Amazon QuickSight throttles the API calls to maintin an optimal experience and reliability for all Amazon QuickSight users.  Common throttling scenarios  The following list provides information about the most commin throttling scenarios that can occur.    A large number of SnapshotExport API jobs are running simultaneously on an Amazon Web Services account. When a new StartDashboardSnapshotJob is created and there are already 12 jobs with the RUNNING status, the new job request fails and returns a LimitExceededException error. Wait for a current job to comlpete before you resubmit the new job.    A large number of API requests are submitted on an Amazon Web Services account. When a user makes more than 10 API calls to the Amazon QuickSight API in one second, a ThrottlingException is returned.   If your use case requires a higher throttling limit, contact your account admin or Amazon Web ServicesSupport to explore options to tailor a more optimal expereince for your account.  Best practices to handle throttling  If your use case projects high levels of API traffic, try to reduce the degree of frequency and parallelism of API calls as much as you can to avoid throttling. You can also perform a timing test to calculate an estimate for the total processing time of your projected load that stays within the throttling limits of the Amazon QuickSight APIs. For example, if your projected traffic is 100 snapshot jobs before 12:00 PM per day, start 12 jobs in parallel and measure the amount of time it takes to proccess all 12 jobs. Once you obtain the result, multiply the duration by 9, for example (12 minutes * 9 = 108 minutes). Use the new result to determine the latest time at which the jobs need to be started to meet your target deadline. The time that it takes to process a job can be impacted by the following factors:   The dataset type (Direct Query or SPICE).   The size of the dataset.   The complexity of the calculated fields that are used in the dashboard.   The number of visuals that are on a sheet.   The types of visuals that are on the sheet.   The number of formats and snapshots that are requested in the job configuration.   The size of the generated snapshots",
