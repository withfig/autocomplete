You can use rate and cron expressions to create recurring schedules. Rate-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target at regular intervals, such as every 15 minutes or every five days. Cron-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target periodically at a specific time, such as at 8:00 am (UTC+0) every 1st day of the month.   A cron expression consists of six fields separated by white spaces: (minutes hours day_of_month month day_of_week year).   A rate expression consists of a value as a positive integer, and a unit with the following options: minute | minutes | hour | hours | day | days   For more information and examples, see Schedule types on EventBridge Scheduler in the EventBridge Scheduler User Guide",
