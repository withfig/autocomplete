    "With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity providers (IdPs) in this API, you can link IdP users to native user profiles. Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users at Adding user pool sign-in through a third party and in the User pool federation endpoints and hosted UI reference. This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and object types in Amazon Cognito. Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and server-side authentication of users. You can interact with operations in the Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the following subjects.   An administrator who wants to configure user pools, app clients, users, groups, or other user pool functions.   A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its Amazon Web Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.   A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make unauthenticated requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.   For more information, see Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. With your Amazon Web Services SDK, you can build the logic to support operational flows in every use case for this API. You can also make direct REST API requests to Amazon Cognito user pools service endpoints.

If the user that you want to deactivate is a Amazon Cognito user pools native username + password user, they can't use their password to sign in. If the user to deactivate is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser, the user must create a new user account. See AdminLinkProviderForUser. The ProviderName must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool.  To deactivate a native username + password user, the ProviderName value must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject. The ProviderAttributeValue must be the name that is used in the user pool for the user. The ProviderAttributeName must always be Cognito_Subject for social IdPs. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user. For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign in, the ProviderAttributeName and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were used for the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked using  AdminLinkProviderForUser call. (If the linking was done with ProviderAttributeName set to Cognito_Subject, the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the SAML assertion.

You can then use the federated user identity to sign in as the existing user account.   For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password, this API links that user to a federated user identity. When the user signs in with a federated user identity, they sign in as the existing user account.  The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is five.

Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in. If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox.

An AdminRespondToAuthChallenge API request provides the answer to that challenge, like a code or a secure remote password (SRP). The parameters of a response to an authentication challenge vary with the type of challenge. For more information about custom authentication challenges, see Custom authentication challenge Lambda triggers.  This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in. If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In  sandbox mode , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production.

AdminSetUserPassword can set a password for the user profile that Amazon Cognito creates for third-party federated users. When you set a password, the federated user's status changes from EXTERNAL_PROVIDER to CONFIRMED.

Repeat the query with each pagination token that is returned until you receive a null pagination token value, and then review the combined result.

A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions of a user pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an Environment tag key to both user pools. The value of this key might be Test for one user pool, and Production for the other. Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs associated with your user pools. In an Identity and Access Management policy, you can constrain permissions for user pools based on specific tags or tag values. You can use this action up to 5 times per second, per account. A user pool can have as many as 50 tags",

            "The authentication flows that you want your user pool client to support. For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions.  If you don't specify a value for ExplicitAuthFlows, your user client supports ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH, ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH, and ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH.  Valid values include:    ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH: Enable admin based user password authentication flow ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH. This setting replaces the ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.    ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH: Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.    ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH: Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.    ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH: Enable SRP-based authentication.    ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH: Enable authflow to refresh tokens.   In some environments, you will see the values ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH, CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY, or USER_PASSWORD_AUTH. You can't assign these legacy ExplicitAuthFlows values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with ALLOW_, like ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH",

You can use this operation to provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a new certificate to Amazon Cognito. You can't use it to change the domain for a user pool. A custom domain is used to host the Amazon Cognito hosted UI, which provides sign-up and sign-in pages for your application. When you set up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with Certificate Manager (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain. Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new certificate automatically. However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito. When you add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N. Virginia) as the Amazon Web Services Region. After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain. For more information about adding a custom domain to your user pool, see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI.
