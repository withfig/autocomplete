  description:
    "Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following foundational data sources - VPC flow logs, Amazon Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, EKS audit logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS volume data, runtime activity belonging to container workloads, such as Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS (including Amazon Web Services Fargate), and Amazon EC2 instances. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IPs and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your Amazon Web Services environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, domains, or presence of malware on your Amazon EC2 instances and container workloads. For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances and container workloads serving malware, or mining bitcoin.  GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments like EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce password strength.  GuardDuty informs you about the status of your Amazon Web Services environment by producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see the  Amazon GuardDuty User Guide",

This step is a prerequisite for managing the associated member accounts either by invitation or through an organization. As a delegated administrator, using CreateMembers will enable GuardDuty in the added member accounts, with the exception of the organization delegated administrator account. A delegated administrator must enable GuardDuty prior to being added as a member. When you use CreateMembers as an Organizations delegated administrator, GuardDuty applies your organization's auto-enable settings to the member accounts in this request, irrespective of the accounts being new or existing members. For more information about the existing auto-enable settings for your organization, see DescribeOrganizationConfiguration. If you disassociate a member account that was added by invitation, the member account details obtained from this API, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the InviteMembers API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with a member account, the delegated administrator must invoke the DeleteMembers API.  When the member accounts added through Organizations are later disassociated, you (administrator) can't invite them by calling the InviteMembers API. You can create an association with these member accounts again only by calling the CreateMembers API",

To invite Amazon Web Services accounts, the first step is to ensure that GuardDuty has been enabled in the potential member accounts. You can now invoke this API to add accounts by invitation.

Each invited Amazon Web Services account can choose to accept the invitation from only one Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see Managing GuardDuty accounts by invitation.

This is done so that you can invoke InviteMembers without the need to invoke CreateMembers again. To remove the details associated with a member account, you must also invoke DeleteMembers.

This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the InviteMembers API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again.
