    "The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for working with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs to determine a home region, as well as to create and work with controls that describe the home region.   You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.   API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region.   If you call a write API outside the home region, an InvalidInputException is returned.   You can call GetHomeRegion action to obtain the account's Migration Hub home region.   For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migration Hub Home Region API reference",
