        "Creates a new secret. A secret can be a password, a set of credentials such as a user name and password, an OAuth token, or other secret information that you store in an encrypted form in Secrets Manager. The secret also includes the connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. For secrets that use managed rotation, you need to create the secret through the managing service. For more information, see Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services.  For information about creating a secret in the console, see Create a secret. To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the SecretString parameter or the SecretBinary parameter, but not both. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it. For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the SecretString matches the JSON structure of a database secret. If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use aws/secretsmanager. Creating aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create and use a customer managed KMS key.  Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except SecretBinary or SecretString because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:CreateSecret. If you include tags in the secret, you also need secretsmanager:TagResource. For more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager.  To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other than aws/secretsmanager, you need kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permission to the key",

The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.   If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken and include it in the request. This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.

Each tag is a key and value pair of strings in a JSON text string, for example:  [{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"},{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"}]  Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc". If you check tags in permissions policies as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the operation and returns an Access Denied error. For more information, see Control access to secrets using tags and Limit access to identities with tags that match secrets\' tags. For information about how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters. If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. For tag quotas and naming restrictions, see Service quotas for Tagging in the Amazon Web Services General Reference guide',

The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a DeletionDate stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently. You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other Regions. You must first delete the replicas using RemoveRegionsFromReplication, and then delete the primary secret. When you delete a replica, it is deleted immediately. You can't directly delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove all staging labels from the version using UpdateSecretVersionStage. This marks the version as deprecated, and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the version in the background. To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during the recovery window. For more information, see  Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion. Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the permanent delete to occur. At any time before recovery window ends, you can use RestoreSecret to remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret. When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value. You must first cancel the deletion with RestoreSecret and then you can retrieve the secret.

Each staging label can be attached to only one version at a time. To add a staging label to a version when it is already attached to another version, Secrets Manager first removes it from the other version first and then attaches it to this one. For more information about versions and staging labels, see Concepts: Version.  The staging labels that you specify in the VersionStage parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels for the version.  You can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by including it in this call.  Whenever you move AWSCURRENT, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.  If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged.
