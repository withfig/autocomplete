Use this operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For example, if you provide www.example.com as input, the returned list can include www.example.com and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain name (*.example.com), if they exist. If you provide *.example.com as input, the returned list can include *.example.com and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, www.example.com, test.example.com, dev.example.com, and so on), if they exist. To list conflicting aliases, you provide the alias to search and the ID of a distribution in your account that has an attached SSL/TLS certificate that includes the provided alias. For more information, including how to set up the distribution and certificate, see Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated.
