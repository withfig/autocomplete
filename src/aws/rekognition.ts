        "Compares a face in the source input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the target input image.   If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.   CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use CompareFaces to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.  You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.  In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.   By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter.   CompareFaces also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don\u2019t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use QualityFilter to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. The default value is NONE.  If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, CompareFaces returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation. If no faces are detected in the source or target images, CompareFaces returns an InvalidParameterException error.    This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.  For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. There are two different settings for stream processors in Amazon Rekognition: detecting faces and detecting labels.   If you are creating a stream processor for detecting faces, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (Input) and a Kinesis data stream (Output) stream for receiving the output. You must use the FaceSearch option in Settings, specifying the collection that contains the faces you want to recognize. After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use StopStreamProcessor to stop processing.   If you are creating a stream processor to detect labels, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (Input), Amazon S3 bucket information (Output), and an Amazon SNS topic ARN (NotificationChannel). You can also provide a KMS key ID to encrypt the data sent to your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify what you want to detect by using the ConnectedHome option in settings, and selecting one of the following: PERSON, PET, PACKAGE, ALL You can also specify where in the frame you want Amazon Rekognition to monitor with RegionsOfInterest. When you run the StartStreamProcessor operation on a label detection stream processor, you input start and stop information to determine the length of the processing time.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a (CustomLabel) object in an array (CustomLabels).

Note that for the DetectCustomLabelsLabels operation, Polygons are not returned in the Geometry section of the response. To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for MinConfidence. DetectCustomLabelsLabels only returns labels with a confidence that's higher than the specified value. The value of MinConfidence maps to the assumed threshold values created during training.

        "Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature.  For an example, see Analyzing images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   Optional Parameters  You can specify one or both of the GENERAL_LABELS and IMAGE_PROPERTIES feature types when calling the DetectLabels API. Including GENERAL_LABELS will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the input image, while including IMAGE_PROPERTIES will ensure the response includes information about the image quality and color. When using GENERAL_LABELS and/or IMAGE_PROPERTIES you can provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering see Detecting Labels in an Image. When getting labels, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to limit the number of labels returned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels. These arguments are only valid when supplying GENERAL_LABELS as a feature type.  Response Elements   For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. The API returns the following types of information about labels:    Name - The name of the detected label.     Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.     Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.     Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.     Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.     BoundingBox \u2014 Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.     The API returns the following information regarding the image, as part of the ImageProperties structure:   Quality - Information about the Sharpness, Brightness, and Contrast of the input image, scored between 0 to 100. Image quality is returned for the entire image, as well as the background and the foreground.    Dominant Color - An array of the dominant colors in the image.    Foreground - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image\u2019s foreground.    Background - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image\u2019s background.   The list of returned labels will include at least one label for every detected object, along with information about that label. In the following example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object, as well as the confidence in the label:  {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}   {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}    {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}  The list of labels can include multiple labels for the same object. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.   {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}  In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.  If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the DetectFaces operation provides.  This is a stateless API operation that doesn't return any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectLabels action",

The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.  The DetectText operation returns text in an array of TextDetection elements, TextDetections. Each TextDetection element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image.  A word is one or more script characters that are not separated by spaces. DetectText can detect up to 100 words in an image. A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the DetectText operation returns multiple lines. To determine whether a TextDetection element is a line of text or a word, use the TextDetection object Type field.  To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis. For more information, see Detecting text in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide",

Each CelebrityRecognition contains information about the celebrity in a CelebrityDetail object and the time, Timestamp, the celebrity was detected. This CelebrityDetail object stores information about the detected celebrity's face attributes, a face bounding box, known gender, the celebrity's name, and a confidence estimate.   GetCelebrityRecognition only returns the default facial attributes (BoundingBox, Confidence, Landmarks, Pose, and Quality). The BoundingBox field only applies to the detected face instance. The other facial attributes listed in the Face object of the following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

The CelebrityDetail object includes the celebrity identifer and additional information urls. If you don't store the additional information urls, you can get them later by calling GetCelebrityInfo with the celebrity identifer. No information is returned for faces not recognized as celebrities. Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned.

For a list of moderation labels in Amazon Rekognition, see Using the image and video moderation APIs. Amazon Rekognition Video inappropriate or offensive content detection in a stored video is an asynchronous operation. You start analysis by calling StartContentModeration which returns a job identifier (JobId). When analysis finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartContentModeration. To get the results of the content analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetContentModeration and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartContentModeration.  For more information, see Working with Stored Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Devlopers Guide.  GetContentModeration returns detected inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive content moderation labels, and the time they are detected, in an array, ModerationLabels, of ContentModerationDetection objects.  By default, the moderated labels are returned sorted by time, in milliseconds from the start of the video. You can also sort them by moderated label by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.  Since video analysis can return a large number of results, use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned in a single call to GetContentModeration. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call GetContentModeration and populate the NextToken request parameter with the value of NextToken returned from the previous call to GetContentModeration.

When the label detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartlabelDetection.

If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection.  GetLabelDetection returns an array of detected labels (Labels) sorted by the time the labels were detected. You can also sort by the label name by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter. If there is no NAME specified, the default sort is by timestamp. You can select how results are aggregated by using the AggregateBy input parameter. The default aggregation method is TIMESTAMPS. You can also aggregate by SEGMENTS, which aggregates all instances of labels detected in a given segment.  The returned Labels array may include the following attributes:   Name - The name of the detected label.   Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.    Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. GetLabelDetection returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.     Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.    Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.   BoundingBox \u2014 Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.   Timestamp - Time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, that the label was detected. For aggregation by SEGMENTS, the StartTimestampMillis, EndTimestampMillis, and DurationMillis structures are what define a segment. Although the \u201cTimestamp\u201d structure is still returned with each label, its value is set to be the same as StartTimestampMillis.   Timestamp and Bounding box information are returned for detected Instances, only if aggregation is done by TIMESTAMPS.

        "Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.  Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations. For more information, see Adding faces to a collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. To get the number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.  If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, IndexFaces indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.  If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the OrientationCorrection field.  To determine which version of the model you're using, call DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of FaceModelVersion in the response from IndexFaces  For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. If you provide the optional ExternalImageId for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the ListFaces operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image. You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the MaxFaces input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don\u2019t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, IndexFaces chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use QualityFilter, to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE.   To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.   Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request parameter.   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.   The face is too blurry.   The image is too dark.   The face has an extreme pose.   The face doesn\u2019t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.   In response, the IndexFaces operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, FaceRecords. This includes:    The bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face.    A confidence value, Confidence, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.   A face ID, FaceId, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.   An image ID, ImageId, assigned by the service for the input image.   If you request ALL or specific facial attributes (e.g., FACE_OCCLUDED) by using the detectionAttributes parameter, Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth), facial occlusion, and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.  The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

        "Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video. Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening, and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person skiing. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartLabelDetection returns a job identifier (JobId) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection.  Optional Parameters   StartLabelDetection has the GENERAL_LABELS Feature applied by default. This feature allows you to provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering, see Detecting labels in a video. You can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 50",
