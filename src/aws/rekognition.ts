        "Compares a face in the source input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the target input image.   If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.   CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use CompareFaces to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.  You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.  In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.   By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter.   CompareFaces also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don\u2019t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use QualityFilter to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. The default value is NONE.  If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, CompareFaces returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation. If no faces are detected in the source or target images, CompareFaces returns an InvalidParameterException error.    This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.  For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CompareFaces action",

The response from CreateProjectVersion is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the version of the model.  Training uses the training and test datasets associated with the project. For more information, see Creating training and test dataset in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide.   You can train a model in a project that doesn't have associated datasets by specifying manifest files in the TrainingData and TestingData fields.  If you open the console after training a model with manifest files, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels creates the datasets for you using the most recent manifest files. You can no longer train a model version for the project by specifying manifest files.  Instead of training with a project without associated datasets, we recommend that you use the manifest files to create training and test datasets for the project.  Training takes a while to complete. You can get the current status by calling DescribeProjectVersions. Training completed successfully if the value of the Status field is TRAINING_COMPLETED. If training fails, see Debugging a failed model training in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels developer guide.  Once training has successfully completed, call DescribeProjectVersions to get the training results and evaluate the model. For more information, see Improving a trained Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels developers guide.  After evaluating the model, you start the model by calling StartProjectVersion. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CreateProjectVersion action",

Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. There are two different settings for stream processors in Amazon Rekognition: detecting faces and detecting labels.   If you are creating a stream processor for detecting faces, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (Input) and a Kinesis data stream (Output) stream. You also specify the face recognition criteria in Settings. For example, the collection containing faces that you want to recognize. After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use StopStreamProcessor to stop processing.   If you are creating a stream processor to detect labels, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (Input), Amazon S3 bucket information (Output), and an Amazon SNS topic ARN (NotificationChannel). You can also provide a KMS key ID to encrypt the data sent to your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify what you want to detect in ConnectedHomeSettings, such as people, packages and people, or pets, people, and packages. You can also specify where in the frame you want Amazon Rekognition to monitor with RegionsOfInterest. When you run the StartStreamProcessor operation on a label detection stream processor, you input start and stop information to determine the length of the processing time.    Use Name to assign an identifier for the stream processor. You use Name to manage the stream processor. For example, you can start processing the source video by calling StartStreamProcessor with the Name field.

To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for MinConfidence. DetectCustomLabelsLabels only returns labels with a confidence that's higher than the specified value.

        "Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature.  For an example, see Analyzing images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.   DetectLabels does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.   {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}   {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}    {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}  In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.   {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}  In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip. In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to limit the number of labels returned.   If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the DetectFaces operation provides.   DetectLabels returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.  DetectLabels also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.  This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectLabels action",

The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.  The DetectText operation returns text in an array of TextDetection elements, TextDetections. Each TextDetection element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image.  A word is one or more script characters that are not separated by spaces. DetectText can detect up to 100 words in an image. A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the DetectText operation returns multiple lines. To determine whether a TextDetection element is a line of text or a word, use the TextDetection object Type field.

Each CelebrityRecognition contains information about the celebrity in a CelebrityDetail object and the time, Timestamp, the celebrity was detected. This CelebrityDetail object stores information about the detected celebrity's face attributes, a face bounding box, known gender, the celebrity's name, and a confidence estimate.   GetCelebrityRecognition only returns the default facial attributes (BoundingBox, Confidence, Landmarks, Pose, and Quality). The BoundingBox field only applies to the detected face instance. The other facial attributes listed in the Face object of the following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.   By default, the Celebrities array is sorted by time (milliseconds from the start of the video). You can also sort the array by celebrity by specifying the value ID in the SortBy input parameter. The CelebrityDetail object includes the celebrity identifier and additional information urls. If you don't store the additional information urls, you can get them later by calling GetCelebrityInfo with the celebrity identifier.

When analysis finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartContentModeration. To get the results of the content analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetContentModeration and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartContentModeration.  For more information, see Working with Stored Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Developers Guide.  GetContentModeration returns detected inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive content moderation labels, and the time they are detected, in an array, ModerationLabels, of ContentModerationDetection objects.  By default, the moderated labels are returned sorted by time, in milliseconds from the start of the video. You can also sort them by moderated label by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.  Since video analysis can return a large number of results, use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned in a single call to GetContentModeration. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call GetContentModeration and populate the NextToken request parameter with the value of NextToken returned from the previous call to GetContentModeration. For more information, see moderating content in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide",

To get the results of the segment detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. if so, call GetSegmentDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call of StartSegmentDetection.  GetSegmentDetection returns detected segments in an array (Segments) of SegmentDetection objects. Segments is sorted by the segment types specified in the SegmentTypes input parameter of StartSegmentDetection. Each element of the array includes the detected segment, the percentage confidence in the accuracy of the detected segment, the type of the segment, and the frame in which the segment was detected. Use SelectedSegmentTypes to find out the type of segment detection requested in the call to StartSegmentDetection. Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of segment detections returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call GetSegmentDetection and populate the NextToken request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to GetSegmentDetection.

        "Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.  Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations. For more information, see Adding faces to a collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. To get the number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.  If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, IndexFaces indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.  If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the OrientationCorrection field.  To determine which version of the model you're using, call DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of FaceModelVersion in the response from IndexFaces  For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. If you provide the optional ExternalImageId for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the ListFaces operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image. You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the MaxFaces input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don\u2019t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, IndexFaces chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use QualityFilter, to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE.   To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.   Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request parameter.   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.   The face is too blurry.   The image is too dark.   The face has an extreme pose.   The face doesn\u2019t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.   In response, the IndexFaces operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, FaceRecords. This includes:    The bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face.    A confidence value, Confidence, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.   A face ID, FaceId, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.   An image ID, ImageId, assigned by the service for the input image.   If you request all facial attributes (by using the detectionAttributes parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.  The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.
