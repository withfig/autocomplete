        "Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in each ticket. Calls to this action are only valid for tickets that are in this status; calls for tickets not in this status result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, one or more players, and an acceptance response. When all players have accepted, Amazon GameLift advances the matchmaking tickets to status PLACING, and attempts to create a new game session for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. Each matchmaking ticket in the failed match is handled as follows:    If the ticket has one or more players who rejected the match or failed to respond, the ticket status is set CANCELLED and processing is terminated.   If all players in the ticket accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match.     Learn more    Add FlexMatch to a game client    FlexMatch events (reference)",

This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.  To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. Add filter options to further restrict how a game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on ACTIVE instances to be claimed. When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to UTILIZED after players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable. If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:   If the game server utilization status is UTILIZED.   If the game server claim status is CLAIMED.   If the game server is running on an instance in DRAINING status and the provided filter option does not allow placing on DRAINING instances.    Learn more   Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide",

For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.

Creates a ContainerGroupDefinition resource that describes a set of containers for hosting your game server with Amazon GameLift managed EC2 hosting. An Amazon GameLift container group is similar to a container "task" and "pod". Each container group can have one or more containers.  Use container group definitions when you create a container fleet. Container group definitions determine how Amazon GameLift deploys your containers to each instance in a container fleet.  You can create two types of container groups, based on scheduling strategy:   A replica container group manages the containers that run your game server application and supporting software. Replica container groups might be replicated multiple times on each fleet instance, depending on instance resources.    A daemon container group manages containers that run other software, such as background services, logging, or test processes. You might use a daemon container group for processes that need to run only once per fleet instance, or processes that need to persist independently of the replica container group.    To create a container group definition, specify a group name, a list of container definitions, and maximum total CPU and memory requirements for the container group. Specify an operating system and scheduling strategy or use the default values. When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool, you can pass in your container definitions as a JSON file.  This operation requires Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to access container images in Amazon ECR repositories. See  IAM permissions for Amazon GameLift for help setting the appropriate permissions.  If successful, this operation creates a new ContainerGroupDefinition resource with an ARN value assigned.

        "This operation has been expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift containers feature, which is currently in public preview.  Creates a fleet of compute resources to host your game servers. Use this operation to set up the following types of fleets based on compute type:   Managed EC2 fleet  An EC2 fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Your game server build is deployed to each fleet instance. Amazon GameLift manages the fleet's instances and controls the lifecycle of game server processes, which host game sessions for players. EC2 fleets can have instances in multiple locations. Each instance in the fleet is designated a Compute. To create an EC2 fleet, provide these required parameters:   Either BuildId or ScriptId     ComputeType set to EC2 (the default value)    EC2InboundPermissions     EC2InstanceType     FleetType     Name     RuntimeConfiguration with at least one ServerProcesses configuration   If successful, this operation creates a new fleet resource and places it in NEW status while Amazon GameLift initiates the fleet creation workflow. To debug your fleet, fetch logs, view performance metrics or other actions on the fleet, create a development fleet with port 22/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote access only when you need them and closing them when you're finished.  When the fleet status is ACTIVE, you can adjust capacity settings and turn autoscaling on/off for each location.  Managed container fleet  A container fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Your container architecture is deployed to each fleet instance based on the fleet configuration. Amazon GameLift manages the containers on each fleet instance and controls the lifecycle of game server processes, which host game sessions for players. Container fleets can have instances in multiple locations. Each container on an instance that runs game server processes is registered as a Compute. To create a container fleet, provide these required parameters:    ComputeType set to CONTAINER     ContainerGroupsConfiguration     EC2InboundPermissions     EC2InstanceType     FleetType set to ON_DEMAND     Name     RuntimeConfiguration with at least one ServerProcesses configuration   If successful, this operation creates a new fleet resource and places it in NEW status while Amazon GameLift initiates the fleet creation workflow.  When the fleet status is ACTIVE, you can adjust capacity settings and turn autoscaling on/off for each location.  Anywhere fleet  An Anywhere fleet represents compute resources that are not owned or managed by Amazon GameLift. You might create an Anywhere fleet with your local machine for testing, or use one to host game servers with on-premises hardware or other game hosting solutions.  To create an Anywhere fleet, provide these required parameters:    ComputeType set to ANYWHERE     Locations specifying a custom location    Name    If successful, this operation creates a new fleet resource and places it in ACTIVE status. You can register computes with a fleet in ACTIVE status.   Learn more   Setting up fleets   Setting up a container fleet   Debug fleet creation issues   Multi-location fleets",

This operation prompts an available server process to start a game session and retrieves connection information for the new game session. As an alternative, consider using the Amazon GameLift game session placement feature with StartGameSessionPlacement , which uses the FleetIQ algorithm and queues to optimize the placement process. When creating a game session, you specify exactly where you want to place it and provide a set of game session configuration settings. The target fleet must be in ACTIVE status.  You can use this operation in the following ways:    To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's home Region, provide a fleet or alias ID along with your game session configuration.    To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's remote location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, along with your game session configuration.    To create a game session on an instance in an Anywhere fleet, specify the fleet's custom location.   If successful, Amazon GameLift initiates a workflow to start a new game session and returns a GameSession object containing the game session configuration and status. When the game session status is ACTIVE, it is updated with connection information and you can create player sessions for the game session. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using UpdateGameSession to change the game session's player session creation policy.

A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.  A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (Amazon GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types, and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed. The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide an alternate set of priorities. To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations. Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity. If successful, a new GameSessionQueue object is returned with an assigned queue ARN.

        "Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an Amazon Web Services account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. You can peer with VPCs in any Amazon Web Services account that you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions. For more information, see VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets. Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need to use CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc.  To establish the connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a connection request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using DescribeVpcPeeringConnections , or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using DescribeFleetEvents .

        "Retrieves the instance limits and current utilization for an Amazon Web Services Region or location. Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location, that your Amazon Web Services account can use. Learn more at Amazon EC2 Instance Types. The information returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect your ability to scale your Amazon GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your account by using the Service limits page in the Amazon GameLift console. Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an Amazon Web Services Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all return different results:    Request specifies the Region ap-northeast-1 with no location. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in us-east-2, by all of the fleets that reside in ap-northeast-1.    Request specifies the Region us-east-1 with location ca-central-1. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in ca-central-1, by all of the fleets that reside in us-east-2. These limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions that deploy instances to ca-central-1.   Request specifies the Region eu-west-1 with location ca-central-1. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in ca-central-1, by all of the fleets that reside in eu-west-1.   This operation can be used in the following ways:   To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed in an Amazon Web Services Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify the Region only. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.   To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed to a remote location by fleets that reside in different Amazon Web Services Region: Provide both the Amazon Web Services Region and the remote location. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.   If successful, an EC2InstanceLimits object is returned with limits and usage data for each requested instance type.

      description:
        "Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\" A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted",

        "This operation has been expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift containers feature, which is currently in public preview.  Registers a compute resource in an Amazon GameLift fleet. Register computes with an Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleet or a container fleet.  For an Anywhere fleet or a container fleet that's running the Amazon GameLift Agent, the Agent handles all compute registry tasks for you. For an Anywhere fleet that doesn't use the Agent, call this operation to register fleet computes. To register a compute, give the compute a name (must be unique within the fleet) and specify the compute resource's DNS name or IP address. Provide a fleet ID and a fleet location to associate with the compute being registered. You can optionally include the path to a TLS certificate on the compute resource. If successful, this operation returns compute details, including an Amazon GameLift SDK endpoint or Agent endpoint. Game server processes running on the compute can use this endpoint to communicate with the Amazon GameLift service. Each server process includes the SDK endpoint in its call to the Amazon GameLift server SDK action InitSDK().  To view compute details, call DescribeCompute with the compute name.

        'Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them into a specified order.  This operation is not designed to continually track game session status because that practice can cause you to exceed your API limit and generate errors. Instead, configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications from a matchmaker or a game session placement queue. When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet\'s locations.  This operation can be used in the following ways:    To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet\'s home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.   To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet\'s home Region or any remote location.   Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.  If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions . To set search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the following game session attributes. For game session search examples, see the Examples section of this topic.    gameSessionId -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}. The filter expression must specify the GameProperty -- a Key and a string Value to search for the game sessions. For example, to search for the above key-value pair, specify the following search filter: gameSessionProperties.difficulty = "novice". All game property values are searched as strings.  For examples of searching game sessions, see the ones below, and also see Search game sessions by game property.     maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.    All APIs by task',

When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request. When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.  To place a new game session request, specify the following:   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request   (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)   If successful, a new game session placement is created.

Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.  When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a GameSessions ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the GameSession resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request. When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled. To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the GameSession ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED.

Updates capacity settings for a managed EC2 fleet or container fleet. For these fleets, you adjust capacity by changing the number of instances in the fleet. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that the fleet can host based on its configuration. For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Use this operation to set these fleet capacity properties:    Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on the number of Amazon EC2 instances allowed. If Amazon GameLift receives a request--either through manual update or automatic scaling--it won't change the capacity to a value outside of this range.   Desired capacity: As an alternative to automatic scaling, manually set the number of Amazon EC2 instances to be maintained. Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, check the maximum capacity of the fleet's Amazon EC2 instance type by calling DescribeEC2InstanceLimits.   To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must be in ACTIVE status.  To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, set the Location parameter to the location to update. The location must be in ACTIVE status. If successful, Amazon GameLift updates the capacity settings and returns the identifiers for the updated fleet and/or location. If a requested change to desired capacity exceeds the instance type's limit, the LimitExceeded exception occurs.  Updates often prompt an immediate change in fleet capacity, such as when current capacity is different than the new desired capacity or outside the new limits. In this scenario, Amazon GameLift automatically initiates steps to add or remove instances in the fleet location. You can track a fleet's current capacity by calling DescribeFleetCapacity or DescribeFleetLocationCapacity.   Learn more   Scaling fleet capacity",

If successful, the fleet ID for the updated fleet is returned. For fleets with remote locations, port setting updates can take time to propagate across all locations.

Updates information about a registered game server to help Amazon GameLift FleetIQ track game server availability. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group.  Use this operation to update the following types of game server information. You can make all three types of updates in the same request:   To update the game server's utilization status from AVAILABLE (when the game server is available to be claimed) to UTILIZED (when the game server is currently hosting games). Identify the game server and game server group and specify the new utilization status. You can't change the status from to UTILIZED to AVAILABLE .   To report health status, identify the game server and game server group and set health check to HEALTHY. If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds.   To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.   Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated.
