    'Amazon Web Services Control Tower offers application programming interface (API) operations that support programmatic interaction with these types of resources:     controls       landing zones       baselines     For more information about these types of resources, see the  Amazon Web Services Control Tower User Guide .  About control APIs  These interfaces allow you to apply the Amazon Web Services library of pre-defined controls to your organizational units, programmatically. In Amazon Web Services Control Tower, the terms "control" and "guardrail" are synonyms. To call these APIs, you\'ll need to know:   the controlIdentifier for the control--or guardrail--you are targeting.   the ARN associated with the target organizational unit (OU), which we call the targetIdentifier.   the ARN associated with a resource that you wish to tag or untag.    To get the controlIdentifier for your Amazon Web Services Control Tower control:  The controlIdentifier is an ARN that is specified for each control. You can view the controlIdentifier in the console on the Control details page, as well as in the documentation. The controlIdentifier is unique in each Amazon Web Services Region for each control. You can find the controlIdentifier for each Region and control in the Tables of control metadata or the Control availability by Region tables in the Amazon Web Services Control Tower User Guide.  A quick-reference list of control identifers for the Amazon Web Services Control Tower legacy Strongly recommended and Elective controls is given in Resource identifiers for APIs and controls in the Controls reference guide section of the Amazon Web Services Control Tower User Guide. Remember that Mandatory controls cannot be added or removed.   ARN format: arn:aws:controltower:{REGION}::control/{CONTROL_NAME}   Example:   arn:aws:controltower:us-west-2::control/AWS-GR_AUTOSCALING_LAUNCH_CONFIG_PUBLIC_IP_DISABLED    To get the targetIdentifier:  The targetIdentifier is the ARN for an OU. In the Amazon Web Services Organizations console, you can find the ARN for the OU on the Organizational unit details page associated with that OU.   OU ARN format:   arn:${Partition}:organizations::${MasterAccountId}:ou/o-${OrganizationId}/ou-${OrganizationalUnitId}     About landing zone APIs  You can configure and launch an Amazon Web Services Control Tower landing zone with APIs. For an introduction and steps, see Getting started with Amazon Web Services Control Tower using APIs. For an overview of landing zone API operations, see  Amazon Web Services Control Tower supports landing zone APIs. The individual API operations for landing zones are detailed in this document, the API reference manual, in the "Actions" section.  About baseline APIs  You can apply the AWSControlTowerBaseline baseline to an organizational unit (OU) as a way to register the OU with Amazon Web Services Control Tower, programmatically. For a general overview of this capability, see Amazon Web Services Control Tower supports APIs for OU registration and configuration with baselines. You can call the baseline API operations to view the baselines that Amazon Web Services Control Tower enables for your landing zone, on your behalf, when setting up the landing zone. These baselines are read-only baselines. The individual API operations for baselines are detailed in this document, the API reference manual, in the "Actions" section. For usage examples, see Baseline API input and output examples with CLI.  Details and examples     Control API input and output examples with CLI     Baseline API input and output examples with CLI     Enable controls with CloudFormation     Launch a landing zone with CloudFormation     Control metadata tables (large page)     Control availability by Region tables (large page)     List of identifiers for legacy controls     Controls reference guide     Controls library groupings     Creating Amazon Web Services Control Tower resources with Amazon Web Services CloudFormation    To view the open source resource repository on GitHub, see aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-resource-providers-controltower   Recording API Requests  Amazon Web Services Control Tower supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Amazon Web Services Control Tower service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Control Tower and its support for CloudTrail, see Logging Amazon Web Services Control Tower Actions with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail in the Amazon Web Services Control Tower User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide',
