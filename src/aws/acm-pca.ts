    "This is the Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a private certificate authority (CA) for your organization. The documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you prefer. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs. Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of times the operation can be called per second. Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web Services Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When a request is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a ThrottlingException error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request rate for APIs.  To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web Services Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase, log into your Amazon Web Services account and visit the Service Quotas console",

You must specify the CA configuration, an optional configuration for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and/or a certificate revocation list (CRL), the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The OCSP configuration can optionally specify a custom URL for the OCSP responder. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA.

Before you can call this action, the following preparations must in place:   In Amazon Web Services Private CA, call the CreateCertificateAuthority action to create the private CA that you plan to back with the imported certificate.   Call the GetCertificateAuthorityCsr action to generate a certificate signing request (CSR).   Sign the CSR using a root or intermediate CA hosted by either an on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.   Create a certificate chain and copy the signed certificate and the certificate chain to your working directory.   Amazon Web Services Private CA supports three scenarios for installing a CA certificate:   Installing a certificate for a root CA hosted by Amazon Web Services Private CA.   Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is hosted by Amazon Web Services Private CA.   Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is externally hosted.   The following additional requirements apply when you import a CA certificate.   Only a self-signed certificate can be imported as a root CA.   A self-signed certificate cannot be imported as a subordinate CA.   Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate that you are importing.   Your root CA must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordinate certificate, if any, that your root CA signed must be next to last. The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate CA must come next, and so on until your chain is built.    The chain must be PEM-encoded.

About Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.   For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.   If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals.

If you don\'t supply this parameter, existing capibilites remain unchanged. For more information, see the OcspConfiguration and CrlConfiguration types. The following requirements apply to revocation configurations.   A configuration disabling CRLs or OCSP must contain only the Enabled=False parameter, and will fail if other parameters such as CustomCname or ExpirationInDays are included.   In a CRL configuration, the S3BucketName parameter must conform to Amazon S3 bucket naming rules.   A configuration containing a custom Canonical Name (CNAME) parameter for CRLs or OCSP must conform to RFC2396 restrictions on the use of special characters in a CNAME.    In a CRL or OCSP configuration, the value of a CNAME parameter must not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".     If you update the S3BucketName of CrlConfiguration, you can break revocation for existing certificates. In other words, if you call UpdateCertificateAuthority to update the CRL configuration\'s S3 bucket name, Amazon Web Services Private CA only writes CRLs to the new S3 bucket. Certificates issued prior to this point will have the old S3 bucket name in your CRL Distribution Point (CDP) extension, essentially breaking revocation. If you must update the S3 bucket, you\'ll need to reissue old certificates to keep the revocation working. Alternatively, you can use a CustomCname in your CRL configuration if you might need to change the S3 bucket name in the future',
