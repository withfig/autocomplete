    "Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack You can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your support cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account. After you configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Services Support App, you can perform the following tasks directly in your Slack channel:   Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases   Request service quota increases for your account   Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that you can chat directly about your support cases   For more information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see the following documentation in the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide:    Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack     Joining a live chat session with Amazon Web Services Support     Requesting service quota increases     Amazon Web Services Support App commands in Slack    You can also use the Amazon Web Services Management Console instead of the Amazon Web Services Support App API to manage your Slack configurations. For more information, see Authorize a Slack workspace to enable the Amazon Web Services Support App.    You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support App API.

This means that only 100 accounts can add the same Slack channel to the Amazon Web Services Support App. We recommend that you only add the accounts that you need to manage support cases for your organization. This can reduce the notifications about case updates that you receive in the Slack channel.  We recommend that you choose a private Slack channel so that only members in that channel have read and write access to your support cases. Anyone in your Slack channel can create, update, or resolve support cases for your account. Users require an invitation to join private channels",
