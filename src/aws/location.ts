Position updates are handled based on the PositionFiltering property of the tracker. When PositionFiltering is set to TimeBased, updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and location data is stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval. If your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID. When PositionFiltering is set to DistanceBased filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft). When PositionFiltering is set to AccuracyBased filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than the measured accuracy. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither stored or evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m. If PositionFiltering is set to AccuracyBased filtering, Amazon Location uses the default value { "Horizontal": 0} when accuracy is not provided on a DevicePositionUpdate',

CalculateRouteMatrix calculates routes and returns the travel time and travel distance from each departure position to each destination position in the request. For example, given departure positions A and B, and destination positions X and Y, CalculateRouteMatrix will return time and distance for routes from A to X, A to Y, B to X, and B to Y (in that order). The number of results returned (and routes calculated) will be the number of DeparturePositions times the number of DestinationPositions.  Your account is charged for each route calculated, not the number of requests.  Requires that you first create a route calculator resource. By default, a request that doesn't specify a departure time uses the best time of day to travel with the best traffic conditions when calculating routes. Additional options include:     Specifying a departure time using either DepartureTime or DepartNow. This calculates routes based on predictive traffic data at the given time.   You can't specify both DepartureTime and DepartNow in a single request. Specifying both parameters returns a validation error.     Specifying a travel mode using TravelMode sets the transportation mode used to calculate the routes.

Grab will synchronize data to the Waypoint environment on weekly basis.

Valid values:    TimeBased - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, but not every location update is stored. If your update frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.     DistanceBased - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4 ft), location updates are ignored. Location updates within this distance are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of geofence evaluations and historical device positions to paginate through. Distance-based filtering can also reduce the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.     AccuracyBased - If the device has moved less than the measured accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved less than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This helps educe the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map, and can help control costs by reducing the number of geofence evaluations",
