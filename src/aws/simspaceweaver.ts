    "SimSpace Weaver (SimSpace Weaver) is a service that you can use to build and run large-scale spatial simulations in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For example, you can create crowd simulations, large real-world environments, and immersive and interactive experiences. For more information about SimSpace Weaver, see the  SimSpace Weaver User Guide . This API reference describes the API operations and data types that you can use to communicate directly with SimSpace Weaver. SimSpace Weaver also provides the SimSpace Weaver app SDK, which you use for app development. The SimSpace Weaver app SDK API reference is included in the SimSpace Weaver app SDK documentation. This documentation is part of the SimSpace Weaver app SDK distributable package",

The state data saved in a snapshot includes entity data from the State Fabric, the simulation configuration specified in the schema, and the clock tick number. You can use the snapshot to initialize a new simulation. For more information about snapshots, see Snapshots in the SimSpace Weaver User Guide.  You specify a Destination when you create a snapshot. The Destination is the name of an Amazon S3 bucket and an optional ObjectKeyPrefix. The ObjectKeyPrefix is usually the name of a folder in the bucket. SimSpace Weaver creates a snapshot folder inside the Destination and places the snapshot file there. The snapshot file is an Amazon S3 object. It has an object key with the form:  object-key-prefix/snapshot/simulation-name-YYMMdd-HHmm-ss.zip, where:      YY  is the 2-digit year     MM  is the 2-digit month     dd  is the 2-digit day of the month     HH  is the 2-digit hour (24-hour clock)     mm  is the 2-digit minutes     ss  is the 2-digit seconds",
