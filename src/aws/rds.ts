  description:
    "Amazon Relational Database Service  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique. Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use. This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.  Amazon RDS API Reference    For the alphabetical list of API actions, see API Actions.   For the alphabetical list of data types, see Data Types.   For a list of common query parameters, see Common Parameters.   For descriptions of the error codes, see Common Errors.    Amazon RDS User Guide    For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, see Available RDS Interfaces.   For more information about how to use the Query API, see Using the Query API",

A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup. Once you've created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using ModifyDBCluster. When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Aurora DB cluster, reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect. When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Multi-AZ DB cluster, reboot the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.  After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the Amazon RDS console or the DescribeDBClusterParameters operation to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.

This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB instance. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:    DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.    SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115.   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process.  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.   To delete a DB instance in this case, first use the PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster operation to promote the DB cluster so that it's no longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, use the DeleteDBInstance operation to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.  For RDS Custom DB instances, deleting the DB instance permanently deletes the EC2 instance and the associated EBS volumes.

For an Aurora DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster writer). For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, after RDS terminates the primary DB instance, the internal monitoring system detects that the primary DB instance is unhealthy and promotes a readable standby (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster writer). Failover times are typically less than 35 seconds. An Amazon Aurora DB cluster automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica, if one exists, when the primary DB instance fails. A Multi-AZ DB cluster automatically fails over to a readable standby DB instance when the primary DB instance fails. To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a failover. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, make sure to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.

Switchover operations were previously called \"managed planned failovers.\"  Although this operation can be used either to fail over or to switch over a global database cluster, its intended use is for global database failover. To switch over a global database cluster, we recommend that you use the SwitchoverGlobalCluster operation instead.  How you use this operation depends on whether you are failing over or switching over your global database cluster:   Failing over - Specify the AllowDataLoss parameter and don't specify the Switchover parameter.   Switching over - Specify the Switchover parameter or omit it, but don't specify the AllowDataLoss parameter.    About failing over and switching over  While failing over and switching over a global database cluster both change the primary DB cluster, you use these operations for different reasons:    Failing over - Use this operation to respond to an unplanned event, such as a Regional disaster in the primary Region. Failing over can result in a loss of write transaction data that wasn't replicated to the chosen secondary before the failover event occurred. However, the recovery process that promotes a DB instance on the chosen seconday DB cluster to be the primary writer DB instance guarantees that the data is in a transactionally consistent state. For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see Performing managed failovers for Aurora global databases in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.    Switching over - Use this operation on a healthy global database cluster for planned events, such as Regional rotation or to fail back to the original primary DB cluster after a failover operation. With this operation, there is no data loss.

After you modify a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the modify operation before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter.

        "Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment. If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot operation. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot operation. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot. If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the DBSnapshotIdentifier must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.  This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot",
