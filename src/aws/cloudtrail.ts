    "CloudTrail This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail. CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.  As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services.  See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files",

If you want your trail to log Insights events, be sure the event selector enables logging of the Insights event types you want configured for your trail. For more information about logging Insights events, see Logging Insights events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event. Example   You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.   The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances API operations occur in your account.   CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.   The RunInstances is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.   The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.    The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException exception is thrown. You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see Logging management events, Logging data events, and Quotas in CloudTrail in the CloudTrail User Guide. You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or EventSelectors, but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are overwritten.

For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events when the eventTime is older than 90 days.  If you decrease the retention period of an event data store, CloudTrail will remove any events with an eventTime older than the new retention period.

Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.  CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys.
