Any defined value in an environmental variable is considered a string literal and not expanded.   Variable evaluations should ideally be performed in the function code.   When creating an environmental variable key-value pair, it must follow the additional constraints below:   Keys must begin with a letter.   Keys must be at least two characters long.   Keys can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character (_).   Values can be up to 512 characters long.   You can configure up to 50 key-value pairs in a GraphQL API.   You can create a list of environmental variables by adding it to the environmentVariables payload as a list in the format {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2", \u2026}. Note that each call of the PutGraphqlApiEnvironmentVariables action will result in the overwriting of the existing environmental variable list of that API.

Keys can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character (_).   Values can be up to 512 characters long.   You can configure up to 50 key-value pairs in a GraphQL API.
