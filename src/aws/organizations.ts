    "Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their resources. This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the Organizations User Guide.  Support and feedback for Organizations  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com or post your feedback and questions in the Organizations support forum. For more information about the Amazon Web Services support forums, see Forums Help.  Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK  For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1 region for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify cn-northwest-1. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:   Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:  --endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)  or  --endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)    Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:  aws configure set default.region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)  or  aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)    Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:  --region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)  or  --region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)     Recording API Requests  Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see Logging Organizations API calls with CloudTrail in the Organizations User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the CloudTrail User Guide",

You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region that is paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial Region.   You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region.   You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.

For more information, see Organizations and service-linked roles in the Organizations User Guide. Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:   Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.   Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.

To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the TagResource operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see Organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.

To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see Logging and monitoring in Organizations in the Organizations User Guide.    When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see Organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide. For more information about creating accounts, see Creating a member account in your organization in the Organizations User Guide.    When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is not automatically collected.

If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following actions to occur:   The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the accounts in your organization. This means that the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.

Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or resources related to the integration, while other services stop accessing the organization but leave any historical data and configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the integration.   Using the other service's console or commands to disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other Amazon Web Services service.
