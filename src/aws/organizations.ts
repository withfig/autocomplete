For more information on the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, see the  AWS GovCloud User Guide.    You already have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region that is paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial Region.   You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region.   You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.    AWS Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide.  AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:   Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.   Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.    If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the TagResource operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see AWS Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.

Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization.

Using the other service's console or commands to disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration.
