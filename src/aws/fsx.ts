You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination Region per account. You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-Region disaster recovery. You can periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your Amazon Web Services partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. Amazon Web Services currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (Amazon Web Services GovCloud [US] Regions). You can also use backup copies to clone your file dataset to another Region or within the same Region. You can use the SourceRegion parameter to specify the Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the us-west-1 Region and want to copy a backup from the us-east-2 Region, you specify us-east-2 in the SourceRegion parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

Then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleFileSystem operation. By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup isn't subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted. To delete an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, first unmount it from every connected Amazon EC2 instance, then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleFileSystem operation. By default, Amazon FSx will not take a final backup when the DeleteFileSystem operation is invoked.

To ensure all of your data is written back to S3 before deleting your file system, you can either monitor for the AgeOfOldestQueuedMessage metric to be zero (if using automatic export) or you can run an export data repository task.

You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account.
