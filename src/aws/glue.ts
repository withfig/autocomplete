If there are particular columns contain sensitive data, data lake administrators can define column filters that exclude access to specific columns.    CELL_FILTER_PERMISSION - Cell-level filtering combines column filtering (include or exclude columns) and row filter expressions to restrict access to individual elements in the table.    NESTED_PERMISSION - Nested permissions combines cell-level filtering and nested column filtering to restrict access to columns and/or nested columns in specific rows based on row filter expressions.    NESTED_CELL_PERMISSION - Nested cell permissions combines nested permission with nested cell-level filtering. This allows different subsets of nested columns to be restricted based on an array of row filter expressions.    Note: Each of these permission types follows a hierarchical order where each subsequent permission type includes all permission of the previous type. Important: If you provide a supported permission type that doesn't match the user's level of permissions on the table, then Lake Formation raises an exception. For example, if the third-party engine calling the GetUnfilteredTableMetadata operation can enforce only column-level filtering, and the user has nested cell filtering applied on the table, Lake Formation throws an exception, and will not return unfiltered table metadata and data access credentials",
