        "This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.  To verify that all parts have been removed and prevent getting charged for the part storage, you should call the ListParts API operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.

        "Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart operation or the UploadPartCopy operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this CompleteMultipartUpload operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the PartNumber value and the ETag value that are returned after that part was uploaded. The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. The error response might be embedded in the 200 OK response. If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error).  Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry any failed requests (including 500 error responses). For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices.  You can't use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded for the CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if you don't provide a Content-Type header, CompleteMultipartUpload can still return a 200 OK response.

You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API.  You can copy individual objects between general purpose buckets, between directory buckets, and between general purpose buckets and directory buckets.   Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. For more information about how to enable a Region for your account, see Enable or disable a Region for standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services Account Management Guide.  Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see Transfer Acceleration.   Authentication and authorization  All CopyObject requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see REST Authentication.  Directory buckets - You must use the IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the CopyObject API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the CreateSession API operation. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.  Permissions  You must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket.    General purpose bucket permissions - You must have permissions in an IAM policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a CopyObject operation.   If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have  s3:GetObject  permission to read the source object that is being copied.    If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have  s3:PutObject  permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.       Directory bucket permissions - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a CopyObject operation.   If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the  s3express:CreateSession  permission in the Action element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is in the ReadWrite mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the s3express:SessionMode condition key to ReadOnly on the copy source bucket.   If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the  s3express:CreateSession  permission in the Action element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The s3express:SessionMode condition key can't be set to ReadOnly on the copy destination bucket.    For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Response and special errors  When the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. When the request is not an HTTP 1.1 request, the response would not contain the Content-Length. You always need to read the entire response body to check if the copy succeeds. to keep the connection alive while we copy the data.    If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.   A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. A 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error.   If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error.   If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. For example, in a cross-region copy, you may encounter throttling and receive a 200 OK response. For more information, see Resolve the Error 200 response when copying objects to Amazon S3. The 200 OK status code means the copy was accepted, but it doesn't mean the copy is complete. Another example is when you disconnect from Amazon S3 before the copy is complete, Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and you may receive a 200 OK response. You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until the entire response is successfully received and processed. If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the content of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error).      Charge  The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. The request can also result in a data retrieval charge for the source if the source storage class bills for data retrieval. If the copy source is in a different region, the data transfer is billed to the copy source account. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing.

If the source object is an object that was uploaded by using a multipart upload, the object copy will be a single part object after the source object is copied to the destination bucket. You specify the value of the copy source in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point:   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the general purpose bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded. To copy the object reports/january.pdf from the directory bucket awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3, use awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.    Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.   Access points are not supported by directory buckets.    Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.    If your source bucket versioning is enabled, the x-amz-copy-source header by default identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId query parameter. Specifically, append ?versionId=<version-id> to the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893). If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object. If you enable versioning on the destination bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the copied object. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response. If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the destination bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates in the x-amz-version-id response header is always null.

        "This action creates an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see  CreateBucket .  Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. There are two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more information about these bucket types, see Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     General purpose buckets - If you send your CreateBucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com global endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. So the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region_code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - In addition to the s3:CreateBucket permission, the following permissions are required in a policy when your CreateBucket request includes specific headers:     Access control lists (ACLs) - In your CreateBucket request, if you specify an access control list (ACL) and set it to public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you explicitly specify any other custom ACLs, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are required. In your CreateBucket request, if you set the ACL to private, or if you don't specify any ACLs, only the s3:CreateBucket permission is required.     Object Lock - In your CreateBucket request, if you set x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled to true, the s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and s3:PutBucketVersioning permissions are required.    S3 Object Ownership - If your CreateBucket request includes the x-amz-object-ownership header, then the s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls permission is required.   To set an ACL on a bucket as part of a CreateBucket request, you must explicitly set S3 Object Ownership for the bucket to a different value than the default, BucketOwnerEnforced. Additionally, if your desired bucket ACL grants public access, you must first create the bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then explicitly disable Block Public Access on the bucket before using PutBucketAcl to set the ACL. If you try to create a bucket with a public ACL, the request will fail.   For the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that you keep all Block Public Access settings enabled and keep ACLs disabled. If you would like to share data with users outside of your account, you can use bucket policies as needed. For more information, see Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket  and Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in the Amazon S3 User Guide.      S3 Block Public Access - If your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3 resources, you can disable Block Public Access. Specifically, you can create a new bucket with Block Public Access enabled, then separately call the  DeletePublicAccessBlock  API. To use this operation, you must have the s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock permission. For more information about S3 Block Public Access, see Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in the Amazon S3 User Guide.       Directory bucket permissions - You must have the s3express:CreateBucket permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  The permissions for ACLs, Object Lock, S3 Object Ownership, and S3 Block Public Access are not supported for directory buckets. For directory buckets, all Block Public Access settings are enabled at the bucket level and S3 Object Ownership is set to Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled). These settings can't be modified.  For more information about permissions for creating and working with directory buckets, see Directory buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.   If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the created multipart upload must be completed within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration.     Directory buckets  - S3 Lifecycle is not supported by directory buckets.    Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     Request signing  For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart upload and permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions and Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Encryption     General purpose buckets - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart and UploadPartCopy requests must match the headers you used in the CreateMultipartUpload request.   Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS) \u2013 If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.    x-amz-server-side-encryption     x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id     x-amz-server-side-encryption-context       If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3 key) in KMS to protect the data.   To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions and Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role is in a different account from the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.   All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by KMS fail if you don't make them by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4. For information about configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Use customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) \u2013 If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.    x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), see  Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

For more information about Zonal endpoint APIs that include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint, see S3 Express One Zone APIs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the CreateSession API operation. Specifically, you grant s3express:CreateSession permission to a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make the CreateSession API request on the bucket, which returns temporary security credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token, and expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal endpoint APIs. After the session is created, you don\u2019t need to use other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication. You also apply the session token to the x-amz-s3session-token request header for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with those credentials will fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a CreateSession API request that generates a new set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified interval. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more information, see Performance guidelines and design patterns in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    You must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     CopyObject API operation - Unlike other Zonal endpoint APIs, the CopyObject API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials returned from the CreateSession API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the CopyObject API operation on directory buckets, see CopyObject.     HeadBucket API operation - Unlike other Zonal endpoint APIs, the HeadBucket API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials returned from the CreateSession API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the HeadBucket API operation on directory buckets, see HeadBucket.     Permissions  To obtain temporary security credentials, you must create a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants s3express:CreateSession permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the s3express:SessionMode condition key to control who can create a ReadWrite or ReadOnly session. For more information about ReadWrite or ReadOnly sessions, see  x-amz-create-session-mode . For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To grant cross-account access to Zonal endpoint APIs, the bucket policy should also grant both accounts the s3express:CreateSession permission.

        "Removes an object from a bucket. The behavior depends on the bucket's versioning state:    If bucket versioning is not enabled, the operation permanently deletes the object.   If bucket versioning is enabled, the operation inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current version of the object. To permanently delete an object in a versioned bucket, you must include the object\u2019s versionId in the request. For more information about versioning-enabled buckets, see Deleting object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket.   If bucket versioning is suspended, the operation removes the object that has a null versionId, if there is one, and inserts a delete marker that becomes the current version of the object. If there isn't an object with a null versionId, and all versions of the object have a versionId, Amazon S3 does not remove the object and only inserts a delete marker. To permanently delete an object that has a versionId, you must include the object\u2019s versionId in the request. For more information about versioning-suspended buckets, see Deleting objects from versioning-suspended buckets.       Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null to the versionId query parameter in the request.    Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    To remove a specific version, you must use the versionId query parameter. Using this query parameter permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header x-amz-delete-marker to true.  If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the x-amz-mfa request header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS. For more information about MFA Delete, see Using MFA Delete in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To see sample requests that use versioning, see Sample Request.    Directory buckets - MFA delete is not supported by directory buckets.  You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or calling (PutBucketLifecycle) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the s3:DeleteObject, s3:DeleteObjectVersion, and s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration actions.    Directory buckets - S3 Lifecycle is not supported by directory buckets.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - The following permissions are required in your policies when your DeleteObjects request includes specific headers.     s3:DeleteObject  - To delete an object from a bucket, you must always have the s3:DeleteObject permission.     s3:DeleteObjectVersion  - To delete a specific version of an object from a versioning-enabled bucket, you must have the s3:DeleteObjectVersion permission.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.

        "This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead. The request can contain a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.     Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets.    Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body. When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see MFA Delete in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory buckets - MFA delete is not supported by directory buckets.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - The following permissions are required in your policies when your DeleteObjects request includes specific headers.     s3:DeleteObject  - To delete an object from a bucket, you must always specify the s3:DeleteObject permission.     s3:DeleteObjectVersion  - To delete a specific version of an object from a versiong-enabled bucket, you must specify the s3:DeleteObjectVersion permission.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Content-MD5 request header     General purpose bucket - The Content-MD5 request header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.    Directory bucket - The Content-MD5 request header or a additional checksum request header (including x-amz-checksum-crc32, x-amz-checksum-crc32c, x-amz-checksum-sha1, or x-amz-checksum-sha256) is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.    HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.   The following operations are related to DeleteObjects:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     ListParts     AbortMultipartUpload",

        "Retrieves an object from Amazon S3. In the GetObject request, specify the full key name for the object.  General purpose buckets - Both the virtual-hosted-style requests and the path-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the object key name as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets - Only virtual-hosted-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3, specify the object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. Also, when you make requests to this API operation, your requests are sent to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - You must have the required permissions in a policy. To use GetObject, you must have the READ access to the object (or version). If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, the GetObject operation returns the object without using an authorization header. For more information, see Specifying permissions in a policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you include a versionId in your request header, you must have the s3:GetObjectVersion permission to access a specific version of an object. The s3:GetObject permission is not required in this scenario. If you request the current version of an object without a specific versionId in the request header, only the s3:GetObject permission is required. The s3:GetObjectVersion permission is not required in this scenario.  If the object that you request doesn\u2019t exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found error.   If you don\u2019t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 Access Denied error.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Storage classes  If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class, the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject. Otherwise, this operation returns an InvalidObjectState error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, only the S3 Express One Zone storage class is supported to store newly created objects. Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request.  Encryption  Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for the GetObject requests, if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your GetObject requests for the object that uses these types of keys, you\u2019ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error.  Overriding response header values through the request  There are times when you want to override certain response header values of a GetObject response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value through your GetObject request. You can override values for a set of response headers. These modified response header values are included only in a successful response, that is, when the HTTP status code 200 OK is returned. The headers you can override using the following query parameters in the request are a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object.  The response headers that you can override for the GetObject response are Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, Content-Encoding, Content-Language, Content-Type, and Expires. To override values for a set of response headers in the GetObject response, you can use the following query parameters in the request.    response-cache-control     response-content-disposition     response-content-encoding     response-content-language     response-content-type     response-expires     When you use these parameters, you must sign the request by using either an Authorization header or a presigned URL. These parameters cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

GetObjectAttributes combines the functionality of HeadObject and ListParts. All of the data returned with each of those individual calls can be returned with a single call to GetObjectAttributes.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - To use GetObjectAttributes, you must have READ access to the object. The permissions that you need to use this operation with depend on whether the bucket is versioned. If the bucket is versioned, you need both the s3:GetObjectVersion and s3:GetObjectVersionAttributes permissions for this operation. If the bucket is not versioned, you need the s3:GetObject and s3:GetObjectAttributes permissions. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the object that you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found (\"no such key\") error.   If you don't have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (\"access denied\") error.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Encryption   Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for HEAD requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used when you PUT an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a GET request for an object that uses these types of keys, you\u2019ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.  If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory bucket permissions - For directory buckets, only server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) is supported.   Versioning   Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null to the versionId query parameter in the request.  Conditional request headers  Consider the following when using request headers:   If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code 200 OK and the data requested:    If-Match condition evaluates to true.    If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false.   For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.   If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code 304 Not Modified:    If-None-Match condition evaluates to false.    If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true.   For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.

A HEAD request has the same options as a GET operation on an object. The response is identical to the GET response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the HEAD request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, 412 Precondition Failed, or 304 Not Modified. It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes. Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see Common Request Headers.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions      General purpose bucket permissions - To use HEAD, you must have the s3:GetObject permission. You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3 in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found error.   If you don\u2019t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 Forbidden error.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Encryption   Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for HEAD requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used when you PUT an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a HEAD request for an object that uses these types of keys, you\u2019ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.  If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory bucket permissions - For directory buckets, only server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) is supported.   Versioning    If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.   If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error and the Last-Modified: timestamp response header.       Directory buckets - Delete marker is not supported by directory buckets.    Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null to the versionId query parameter in the request.     HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.

        "This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by the CreateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted.   Directory buckets - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed.   The ListMultipartUploads operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that satisfy your ListMultipartUploads request, the response returns an IsTruncated element with the value of true, a NextKeyMarker element, and a NextUploadIdMarker element. To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent ListMultipartUploads requests. In these requests, include two query parameters: key-marker and upload-id-marker. Set the value of key-marker to the NextKeyMarker value from the previous response. Similarly, set the value of upload-id-marker to the NextUploadIdMarker value from the previous response.   Directory buckets - The upload-id-marker element and the NextUploadIdMarker element aren't supported by directory buckets. To list the additional multipart uploads, you only need to set the value of key-marker to the NextKeyMarker value from the previous response.   For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Sorting of multipart uploads in response     General purpose bucket - In the ListMultipartUploads response, the multipart uploads are sorted based on two criteria:   Key-based sorting - Multipart uploads are initially sorted in ascending order based on their object keys.   Time-based sorting - For uploads that share the same object key, they are further sorted in ascending order based on the upload initiation time. Among uploads with the same key, the one that was initiated first will appear before the ones that were initiated later.      Directory bucket - In the ListMultipartUploads response, the multipart uploads aren't sorted lexicographically based on the object keys.     HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.   The following operations are related to ListMultipartUploads:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     ListParts     AbortMultipartUpload",

Bucket names must follow the format  bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3 (for example,  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com.

For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket. You must have permission to perform the s3:ListBucket action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Sorting order of returned objects     General purpose bucket - For general purpose buckets, ListObjectsV2 returns objects in lexicographical order based on their key names.    Directory bucket - For directory buckets, ListObjectsV2 does not return objects in lexicographical order.    HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.    This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recommend that you use this revised API operation for application development. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the prior version of this API operation, ListObjects.

You obtain this uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload request through CreateMultipartUpload. The ListParts request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The limit of 1,000 parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of parts in a response by specifying the max-parts request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an IsTruncated field with the value of true, and a NextPartNumberMarker element. To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent ListParts requests, include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value to the NextPartNumberMarker field value from the previous response. For more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the upload was created using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), you must have permission to the kms:Decrypt action for the ListParts request to succeed.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.

        'This operation is not supported by directory buckets.  Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see Using ACLs. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have the WRITE_ACP permission. You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket\'s permissions:   Specify the ACL in the request body   Specify permissions using request headers    You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.  Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions  You can set access permissions by using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id \u2013 if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account    uri \u2013 if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress \u2013 if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (S\u00e3o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", id="111122223333", id="555566667777"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you\'re assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person\'s ID:  <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request   By URI:  <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>    By Email address:  <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>&</Grantee>  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket. You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. See the DataExport request element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you specify a destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different account.

To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the s3:PutBucketCORS action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others. You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your Amazon S3 bucket at my.example.bucket.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability. To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the cors subresource to the bucket. The cors subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.  When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the cors configuration on the bucket and uses the first CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:   The request's Origin header must match AllowedOrigin elements.   The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the Access-Control-Request-Method header in case of a pre-flight OPTIONS request must be one of the AllowedMethod elements.    Every header specified in the Access-Control-Request-Headers request header of a pre-flight request must match an AllowedHeader element.

Keep in mind that this will overwrite an existing lifecycle configuration, so if you want to retain any configuration details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see Managing your storage lifecycle.  Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, object size, or any combination of these. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility. For the related API description, see PutBucketLifecycle.   Rules  You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration can have up to 1,000 rules. This limit is not adjustable. Each rule consists of the following:   A filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, object size, or any combination of these.   A status indicating whether the rule is in effect.   One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and noncurrent object versions.   For more information, see Object Lifecycle Management and Lifecycle Configuration Elements.  Permissions  By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration permission. You can also explicitly deny permissions. An explicit deny also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:    s3:DeleteObject     s3:DeleteObjectVersion     s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration    For more information about permissions, see Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.

The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the specified type. By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification configuration will be an empty NotificationConfiguration.  <NotificationConfiguration>   </NotificationConfiguration>  This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you include in the request body. After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events. You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element. For more information about the number of event notification configurations that you can create per bucket, see Amazon S3 service quotas in Amazon Web Services General Reference. By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with the required s3:PutBucketNotification permission.  The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations.

If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.

For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions  If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must both have the PutBucketPolicy permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation. If you don't have PutBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.  To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon Web Services account can perform the GetBucketPolicy, PutBucketPolicy, and DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing these API actions by VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.

Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information. You can invoke this request for a specific Amazon Web Services Region by using the  aws:RequestedRegion  condition key. A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset. To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority.  If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see Backward Compatibility.  For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Versioning.  Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects  By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: SourceSelectionCriteria, SseKmsEncryptedObjects, Status, EncryptionConfiguration, and ReplicaKmsKeyID. For information about replication configuration, see Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys. For information on PutBucketReplication errors, see List of replication-related error codes   Permissions  To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have s3:PutReplicationConfiguration permissions for the bucket.  By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.

If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. All objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.    Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. However, Amazon S3 provides features that can modify this behavior:    S3 Object Lock - To prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use Amazon S3 Object Lock in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.     S3 Versioning - When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all versions of the objects. For each write request that is made to the same object, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID of that object being stored in Amazon S3. You can retrieve, replace, or delete any version of the object. For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning.   This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.     Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - The following permissions are required in your policies when your PutObject request includes specific headers.     s3:PutObject  - To successfully complete the PutObject request, you must always have the s3:PutObject permission on a bucket to add an object to it.     s3:PutObjectAcl  - To successfully change the objects ACL of your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectAcl.     s3:PutObjectTagging  - To successfully set the tag-set with your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectTagging.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Data integrity with Content-MD5     General purpose bucket - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. Alternatively, when the object's ETag is its MD5 digest, you can calculate the MD5 while putting the object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.    Directory bucket - This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.    HTTP Host header syntax   Directory buckets  - The HTTP Host header syntax is  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com.

You must have the WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see What permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id \u2013 if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account    uri \u2013 if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress \u2013 if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (S\u00e3o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you\'re assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person\'s ID:  <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.

Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (S\u00e3o Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.     Versioning  The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object.

        "This operation is not supported by directory buckets.  Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3 This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. This action performs the following types of requests:     restore an archive - Restore an archived object   For more information about the S3 structure in the request body, see the following:    PutObject     Managing Access with ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide     Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide     Permissions  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:RestoreObject action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Restoring objects  Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:     Expedited - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1\u20135 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.    Standard - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3\u20135 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.    Bulk - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5\u201312 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.    For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see  Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon S3 User Guide. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide.  Responses  A successful action returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code.    If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns 202 Accepted in the response.    If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the response.      Special errors:    Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress     Cause: Object restore is already in progress.     HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict     SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client         Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable     Cause: expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try again later.

Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the response. This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see Selecting Content from Objects and SELECT Command in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions  You must have the s3:GetObject permission for this operation.\u00a0Amazon S3 Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Object Data Formats  You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format properties:    CSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format.    UTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.    GZIP or BZIP2 - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.    Server-side encryption - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the GetObject. For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Working with the Response Body  Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header with chunked as its value in the response. For more information, see Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response.  GetObject Support  The SelectObjectContent action does not support the following GetObject functionality. For more information, see GetObject.

        "Uploads a part in a multipart upload.  In this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.   You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload limits in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.  For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide .   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession  API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Data integrity   General purpose bucket - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5. For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4).    Directory buckets - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use checksum algorithms to check object integrity.   Encryption     General purpose bucket - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C). Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload operations. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see CreateMultipartUpload. If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following request headers.   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5      Directory bucket - For directory buckets, only server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) is supported.     For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Special errors    Error Code: NoSuchUpload    Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload limits in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Instead of copying data from an existing object as part data, you might use the UploadPart action to upload new data as a part of an object in your request.  You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns the upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request. For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. a multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint.

For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Authentication and authorization  All UploadPartCopy requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see REST Authentication.  Directory buckets - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the UploadPartCopy API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the CreateSession API operation. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.  Permissions  You must have READ access to the source object and WRITE access to the destination bucket.    General purpose bucket permissions - You must have the permissions in a policy based on the bucket types of your source bucket and destination bucket in an UploadPartCopy operation.   If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have the  s3:GetObject  permission to read the source object that is being copied.    If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the  s3:PutObject  permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.    For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types in an UploadPartCopy operation.   If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the  s3express:CreateSession  permission in the Action element of a policy to read the object . By default, the session is in the ReadWrite mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the s3express:SessionMode condition key to ReadOnly on the copy source bucket.   If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the  s3express:CreateSession  permission in the Action element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The s3express:SessionMode condition key cannot be set to ReadOnly on the copy destination.    For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

        "This operation is not supported by directory buckets.  Passes transformed objects to a GetObject operation when using Object Lambda access points. For information about Object Lambda access points, see Transforming objects with Object Lambda access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This operation supports metadata that can be returned by GetObject, in addition to RequestRoute, RequestToken, StatusCode, ErrorCode, and ErrorMessage. The GetObject response metadata is supported so that the WriteGetObjectResponse caller, typically an Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it internally invokes GetObject. When WriteGetObjectResponse is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user GetObject call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return. You can include any number of metadata headers. When including a metadata header, it should be prefaced with x-amz-meta. For example, x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue. The primary use case for this is to forward GetObject metadata. Amazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected through the Amazon Web Services Management Console when you create your Object Lambda access point. Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.  Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.  Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.  For information on how to view and use these functions, see Using Amazon Web Services built Lambda functions in the Amazon S3 User Guide",
