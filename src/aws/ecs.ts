It makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances that you manage. Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls. This makes it easy to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features. You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure",

        "Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action.  On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task definition revision before authorization. When a task definition revision is not specified, authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.  In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see Service load balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when creating or updating a service. volumeConfigurations is only supported for REPLICA service and not DAEMON service. For more infomation, see Amazon EBS volumes in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available:    REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see Service scheduler concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.    DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Service scheduler concepts in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.   You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is initiated by changing properties. For example, the deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired count of a service. This is done with an UpdateService operation. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you set your service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. If they're in the RUNNING state, tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy . If they're in the RUNNING state and reported as healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy . The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service uses the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service uses either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state. This is while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used. This is the case even if they're currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see Amazon ECS deployment types in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement. For information about task placement and task placement strategies, see Amazon ECS task placement in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide  Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance.

The service-linked role is required for services that use multiple target groups. For more information, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If the service uses the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY, and it associates one target group with it. Then, it also associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that you can use to perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it. If you use the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service.

For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, <default> or awsvpc can be used. If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.   When using the host network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.

For more information, see Scheduling Tasks in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Alternatively, you can use StartTask to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances. Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue using the service.  You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when creating or updating a service. For more infomation, see Amazon EBS volumes in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model. This is because of the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command. To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:   Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time.   Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time",

        "Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. Once a container instance has reached an ACTIVE state, you can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.  A container instance can't be changed to DRAINING until it has reached an ACTIVE status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.  When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement. You can use this to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.   Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service aren't affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ACTIVE status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again",

        "Modifies the parameters of a service.  On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task definition revision before authorization. When a task definition revision is not specified, authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.  For services using the rolling update (ECS) you can update the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load balancers, service registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate tags option, task placement constraints and strategies, and task definition. When you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the new configuration.  You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when starting or running a task, or when creating or updating a service. For more infomation, see Amazon EBS volumes in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. You can update your volume configurations and trigger a new deployment. volumeConfigurations is only supported for REPLICA service and not DAEMON service. If you leave volumeConfigurations null, it doesn't trigger a new deployment. For more infomation on volumes, see Amazon EBS volumes in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. For services using the blue/green (CODE_DEPLOY) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, health check grace period, task placement constraints and strategies, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, task definition, or load balancer need to be updated, create a new CodeDeploy deployment. For more information, see CreateDeployment in the CodeDeploy API Reference. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, create a new task set For more information, see CreateTaskSet. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. You can attach Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon ECS tasks by configuring the volume when starting or running a task, or when creating or updating a service. For more infomation, see Amazon EBS volumes in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If you have updated the container image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.  If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you don't need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.  You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment. You can use it to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).   When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout. After this, SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic.   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition. For example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose a different placement strategy.   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.     When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:    Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.    You must have a service-linked role when you update any of the following service properties:    loadBalancers,    serviceRegistries    For more information about the role see the CreateService request parameter  role",

The expiresInMinutes property is always reset when you invoke this operation for a task that already has protectionEnabled set to true. You can keep extending the protection expiration period of a task by invoking this operation repeatedly. To learn more about Amazon ECS task protection, see Task scale-in protection in the  Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .  This operation is only supported for tasks belonging to an Amazon ECS service. Invoking this operation for a standalone task will result in an TASK_NOT_VALID failure.
