Domain  and  DatasetType  - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.     Schema  - A schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type.   After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups. To get a list of all your datasets, use the ListDatasets operation.

Amazon Forecast uses the algorithm to train a predictor using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. You can then generate a forecast using the CreateForecast operation.  To see the evaluation metrics, use the GetAccuracyMetrics operation.  You can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to improve model training. For more information, see FeaturizationConfig. For RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets, CreatePredictor verifies that the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created matches the ForecastFrequency. TARGET_TIME_SERIES datasets don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups. By default, predictors are trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5 (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose custom forecast types to train and evaluate your predictor by setting the ForecastTypes.   AutoML  If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that minimizes the objective function, set PerformAutoML to true.
