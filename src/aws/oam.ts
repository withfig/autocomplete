    "Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using CloudWatch cross-account observability. With CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, traces, and Application Insights applications in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries. Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as monitoring accounts and link them with multiple source accounts. A monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates observability data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, traces in X-Ray, and applications in Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights",

When you create a link, you can optionally specify filters that specify which metric namespaces and which log groups are shared from the source account to the monitoring account. Before you create a link, you must create a sink in the monitoring account and create a sink policy in that account. The sink policy must permit the source account to link to it. You can grant permission to source accounts by granting permission to an entire organization or to individual accounts. For more information, see CreateSink and PutSinkPolicy. Each monitoring account can be linked to as many as 100,000 source accounts. Each source account can be linked to as many as five monitoring accounts",
