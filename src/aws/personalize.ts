When a client calls the GetRecommendations and GetPersonalizedRanking APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.  Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling    A high minProvisionedTPS will increase your cost. We recommend starting with 1 for minProvisionedTPS (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary.   When you create an Amazon Personalize campaign, you can specify the minimum provisioned transactions per second (minProvisionedTPS) for the campaign. This is the baseline transaction throughput for the campaign provisioned by Amazon Personalize. It sets the minimum billing charge for the campaign while it is active. A transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking request. The default minProvisionedTPS is 1.  If your TPS increases beyond the minProvisionedTPS, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minProvisionedTPS. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. When your traffic reduces, capacity returns to the minProvisionedTPS.  You are charged for the the minimum provisioned TPS or, if your requests exceed the minProvisionedTPS, the actual TPS. The actual TPS is the total number of recommendation requests you make. We recommend starting with a low minProvisionedTPS, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary. For more information about campaign costs, see Amazon Personalize pricing.  Status  A campaign can be in one of the following states:   CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED   DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS   To get the campaign status, call DescribeCampaign.

Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond as necessary.  When you create a recommender, you can configure the recommender's minimum recommendation requests per second. The minimum recommendation requests per second (minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) specifies the baseline recommendation request throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize. The default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond is 1. A recommendation request is a single GetRecommendations operation. Request throughput is measured in requests per second and Amazon Personalize uses your requests per second to derive your requests per hour and the price of your recommender usage.   If your requests per second increases beyond minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of requests.  Your bill is the greater of either the minimum requests per hour (based on minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) or the actual number of requests.

Creates the configuration for training a model (creating a solution version). This configuration includes the recipe to use for model training and optional training configuration, such as columns to use in training and feature transformation parameters. For more information about configuring a solution, see Creating and configuring a solution.   By default, new solutions use automatic training to create solution versions every 7 days.
