    "Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data types, and errors.  Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance. Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support internal audits with specific requirements.  Use the following links to get started with the Audit Manager API:    Actions: An alphabetical list of all Audit Manager API operations.    Data types: An alphabetical list of all Audit Manager data types.    Common parameters: Parameters that all operations can use.    Common errors: Client and server errors that all operations can return.   If you're new to Audit Manager, we recommend that you review the  Audit Manager User Guide",

        "Removes the specified Amazon Web Services account as a delegated administrator for Audit Manager.  When you remove a delegated administrator from your Audit Manager settings, you continue to have access to the evidence that you previously collected under that account. This is also the case when you deregister a delegated administrator from Organizations. However, Audit Manager stops collecting and attaching evidence to that delegated administrator account moving forward.  Keep in mind the following cleanup task if you use evidence finder: Before you use your management account to remove a delegated administrator, make sure that the current delegated administrator account signs in to Audit Manager and disables evidence finder first. Disabling evidence finder automatically deletes the event data store that was created in their account when they enabled evidence finder. If this task isn\u2019t completed, the event data store remains in their account. In this case, we recommend that the original delegated administrator goes to CloudTrail Lake and manually deletes the event data store. This cleanup task is necessary to ensure that you don't end up with multiple event data stores. Audit Manager ignores an unused event data store after you remove or change a delegated administrator account. However, the unused event data store continues to incur storage costs from CloudTrail Lake if you don't delete it.  When you deregister a delegated administrator account for Audit Manager, the data for that account isn\u2019t deleted. If you want to delete resource data for a delegated administrator account, you must perform that task separately before you deregister the account. Either, you can do this in the Audit Manager console. Or, you can use one of the delete API operations that are provided by Audit Manager.  To delete your Audit Manager resource data, see the following instructions:     DeleteAssessment (see also: Deleting an assessment in the Audit Manager User Guide)    DeleteAssessmentFramework (see also: Deleting a custom framework in the Audit Manager User Guide)    DeleteAssessmentFrameworkShare (see also: Deleting a share request in the Audit Manager User Guide)    DeleteAssessmentReport (see also: Deleting an assessment report in the Audit Manager User Guide)    DeleteControl (see also: Deleting a custom control in the Audit Manager User Guide)   At this time, Audit Manager doesn't provide an option to delete evidence for a specific delegated administrator. Instead, when your management account deregisters Audit Manager, we perform a cleanup for the current delegated administrator account at the time of deregistration",

Recipients have 120 days to accept or decline the request. If no action is taken, the share request expires. When you create a share request, Audit Manager stores a snapshot of your custom framework in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web Services Region. Audit Manager also stores a backup of the same snapshot in the US West (Oregon) Amazon Web Services Region. Audit Manager deletes the snapshot and the backup snapshot when one of the following events occurs:   The sender revokes the share request.   The recipient declines the share request.   The recipient encounters an error and doesn't successfully accept the share request.   The share request expires before the recipient responds to the request.   When a sender resends a share request, the snapshot is replaced with an updated version that corresponds with the latest version of the custom framework.  When a recipient accepts a share request, the snapshot is replicated into their Amazon Web Services account under the Amazon Web Services Region that was specified in the share request.   When you invoke the StartAssessmentFrameworkShare API, you are about to share a custom framework with another Amazon Web Services account. You may not share a custom framework that is derived from a standard framework if the standard framework is designated as not eligible for sharing by Amazon Web Services, unless you have obtained permission to do so from the owner of the standard framework.
