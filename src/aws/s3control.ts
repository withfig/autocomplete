To delete an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see DeleteBucketReplication in the Amazon S3 API Reference.   Deletes the replication configuration from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket. To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts and Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  It can take a while to propagate PUT or DELETE requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a GET request soon after a PUT or DELETE request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  It can take a while to propagate PUT or DELETE requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a GET request soon after a PUT or DELETE request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.  Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the following information:   The name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want S3 on Outposts to replicate objects   The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that S3 on Outposts can assume to replicate objects on your behalf   Other relevant information, such as replication rules   A replication configuration must include at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 100. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source Outposts bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset. To specify a subset of the objects in the source Outposts bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority. Using PutBucketReplication on Outposts requires that both the source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket. For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see Replication failure reasons in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects  Outposts buckets are encrypted at all times. All the objects in the source Outposts bucket are encrypted and can be replicated. Also, all the replicas in the destination Outposts bucket are encrypted with the same encryption key as the objects in the source Outposts bucket.  Permissions  To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration permissions for the bucket. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts and Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets.   To perform this operation, the user or role must also have the iam:CreateRole and iam:PassRole permissions.

Sets the versioning state for an S3 on Outposts bucket. With S3 Versioning, you can save multiple distinct copies of your objects and recover from unintended user actions and application failures. You can set the versioning state to one of the following:    Enabled - Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.    Suspended - Suspends versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.   If you've never set versioning on your bucket, it has no versioning state. In that case, a  GetBucketVersioning request does not return a versioning state value. When you enable S3 Versioning, for each object in your bucket, you have a current version and zero or more noncurrent versions. You can configure your bucket S3 Lifecycle rules to expire noncurrent versions after a specified time period. For more information, see  Creating and managing a lifecycle configuration for your S3 on Outposts bucket in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you have an object expiration lifecycle configuration in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle configuration will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. For more information, see Versioning in the Amazon S3 User Guide. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

You can associate S3 Batch Operations tags with any job by sending a PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associated with the job. To modify the existing tag set, you can either replace the existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the existing tag set by retrieving the existing tag set using GetJobTagging, modify that tag set, and use this operation to replace the tag set with the one you modified. For more information, see Controlling access and labeling jobs using tags in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     If you send this request with an empty tag set, Amazon S3 deletes the existing tag set on the Batch Operations job. If you use this method, you are charged for a Tier 1 Request (PUT). For more information, see Amazon S3 pricing.   For deleting existing tags for your Batch Operations job, a DeleteJobTagging request is preferred because it achieves the same result without incurring charges.   A few things to consider about using tags:   Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to 50 tags per job.   You can associate up to 50 tags with a job as long as they have unique tag keys.   A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in length, and tag values can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length.   The key and values are case sensitive.
