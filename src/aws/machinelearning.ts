Depending on the input data, the size of the model might affect its performance.  The value is an integer that ranges from 100000 to 2147483648. The default value is 33554432.    sgd.maxPasses - The number of times that the training process traverses the observations to build the MLModel. The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 10000. The default value is 10.    sgd.shuffleType - Whether Amazon ML shuffles the training data. Shuffling the data improves a model's ability to find the optimal solution for a variety of data types. The valid values are auto and none. The default value is none. We strongly recommend that you shuffle your data.    sgd.l1RegularizationAmount - The coefficient regularization L1 norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coefficients. This tends to drive coefficients to zero, resulting in a sparse feature set. If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such as 1.0E-08. The value is a double that ranges from 0 to MAX_DOUBLE. The default is to not use L1 normalization. This parameter can't be used when L2 is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.    sgd.l2RegularizationAmount - The coefficient regularization L2 norm.
