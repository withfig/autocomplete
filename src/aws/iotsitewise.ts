LOCF_INTERPOLATION \u2013 Estimates missing data using last observation carried forward interpolation If no data point is found for an interval, IoT SiteWise returns the last observed data point for the previous interval and carries forward this interpolated value until a new data point is found.

If the interpolation starts July 1, 2021, at 9 AM, IoT SiteWise returns the last observed data point between July 1, 2021, at 9 AM and July 2, 2021, at 9 AM as the first interpolated value.
