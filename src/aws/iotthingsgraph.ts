If deprecateExistingEntities is set to true, all entities in the latest version will be deleted before the new DefinitionDocument is uploaded. When a user uploads entity definitions for the first time, the service creates a new namespace for the user. The new namespace tracks the public namespace. Currently users can have only one namespace. The namespace version increments whenever a user uploads entity definitions that are backwards-incompatible and whenever a user sets the syncWithPublicNamespace parameter or the deprecateExistingEntities parameter to true. The IDs for all of the entities should be in URN format. Each entity must be in the user's namespace. Users can't create entities in the public namespace, but entity definitions can refer to entities in the public namespace. Valid entities are Device, DeviceModel, Service, Capability, State, Action, Event, Property, Mapping, Enum",
