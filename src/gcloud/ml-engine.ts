This tier is suitable for learning how to use AI Platform, and for experimenting with new models using small datasets.\n*basic-gpu*::: Single worker instance with a GPU.\n*basic-tpu*::: Single worker instance with a Cloud TPU.\n*custom*::: CUSTOM tier is not a set tier, but rather enables you to use your own\ncluster specification. When you use this tier, set values to configure your\nprocessing cluster according to these guidelines (using the `--config` flag):\n+\n* You _must_ set `TrainingInput.masterType` to specify the type of machine to\n  use for your master node. This is the only required setting.\n* You _may_ set `TrainingInput.workerCount` to specify the number of workers to\n  use. If you specify one or more workers, you _must_ also set\n  `TrainingInput.workerType` to specify the type of machine to use for your\n  worker nodes.\n* You _may_ set `TrainingInput.parameterServerCount` to specify the number of\n  parameter servers to use. If you specify one or more parameter servers, you\n  _must_ also set `TrainingInput.parameterServerType` to specify the type of\n  machine to use for your parameter servers.  Note that all of your workers must\n  use the same machine type, which can be different from your parameter server\n  type and master type. Your parameter servers must likewise use the same\n  machine type, which can be different from your worker type and master type.\n*premium-1*::: Large number of workers with many parameter servers.\n*standard-1*::: Many workers and a few parameter servers.\n:::\n+",
