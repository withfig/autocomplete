            "Location of source code to deploy.\n+\nLocation of the source can be one of the following three options:\n+\n* Source code in Google Cloud Storage (must be a `.zip` archive),\n* Reference to source repository or,\n* Local filesystem path (root directory of function source).\n+\nNote that, depending on your runtime type, Cloud Functions will look\nfor files with specific names for deployable functions. For Node.js,\nthese filenames are `index.js` or `function.js`. For Python, this is\n`main.py`.\n+\nIf you do not specify the `--source` flag:\n+\n* The current directory will be used for new function deployments.\n* If the function was previously deployed using a local filesystem path,\nthen the function's source code will be updated using the current\ndirectory.\n* If the function was previously deployed using a Google Cloud Storage\nlocation or a source repository, then the function's source code will not\nbe updated.\n+\nThe value of the flag will be interpreted as a Cloud Storage location, if\nit starts with `gs://`.\n+\nThe value will be interpreted as a reference to a source repository, if it\nstarts with `https://`.\n+\nOtherwise, it will be interpreted as the local filesystem path. When\ndeploying source from the local filesystem, this command skips files\nspecified in the `.gcloudignore` file (see `gcloud topic gcloudignore` for\nmore information). If the `.gcloudignore` file doesn't exist, the command\nwill try to create it.\n+\nThe minimal source repository URL is:\n`https://source.developers.google.com/projects/${PROJECT}/repos/${REPO}`\n+\nBy using the URL above, sources from the root directory of the\nrepository on the revision tagged `master` will be used.\n+\nIf you want to deploy from a revision different from `master`, append one\nof the following three sources to the URL:\n+\n* `/revisions/${REVISION}`,\n* `/moveable-aliases/${MOVEABLE_ALIAS}`,\n* `/fixed-aliases/${FIXED_ALIAS}`.\n+\nIf you'd like to deploy sources from a directory different from the root,\nyou must specify a revision, a moveable alias, or a fixed alias, as above,\nand append `/paths/${PATH_TO_SOURCES_DIRECTORY}` to the URL.\n+\nOverall, the URL should match the following regular expression:\n+\n```\n^https://source\\.developers\\.google\\.com/projects/\n(?<accountId>[^/]+)/repos/(?<repoName>[^/]+)\n(((/revisions/(?<commit>[^/]+))|(/moveable-aliases/(?<branch>[^/]+))|\n(/fixed-aliases/(?<tag>[^/]+)))(/paths/(?<path>.*))?)?$\n```\n+\nAn example of a validly formatted source repository URL is:\n+\n```\nhttps://source.developers.google.com/projects/123456789/repos/testrepo/\nmoveable-aliases/alternate-branch/paths/path-to=source\n```\n+",
